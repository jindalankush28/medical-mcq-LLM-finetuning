B) Rinse with saline and reimplant
C) Sterilize tooth and reimplant
D) Scrub the tooth do RCT and reimplant
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g B i.e., Rinse in normal saline & replanted
Hence, the correct answer is B (Rinse with saliva and re-implant). (Note - The text says ""rinse with Saline"" but it's actually rinse with saliva).
Explanation: Avulsion

Avulsion means complete displacement of teeth out of their sockets by application of some external force.
The treatment plan depends on time elapsed before seeking dental attention.

If seen within 30 min → Replantation can be considered
If seen after 1 hour → Autotransplantation may be indicated
If found >24 hours later → Extraction is recommended
HENCE REIMPLANTATION IS DONE WITHIN 30 MINUTES OF AVULSION AND IF NOT THEN AUTOTRANSPLANTION CAN BE CONSIDERED.
Hence,
Reimplantation is done if the tooth has been displaced less than 30 minutes prior to presentation at the clinic.
Autografting is an alternative when there is delay between injury and arrival at the office (> 30min)
Extraction is usually required when the periodontal ligament is contaminated beyond salvageable limits.

### Response:
 g Point B has highest risk of dental caries due to high bacterial load & low pH.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Point B). (-Ref: Textbook of Pedodontics Sridhar Premkumar Ed2s Pg- 71)
Most common site of early childhood caries - Maxillary anterior teeth.
Least affected tooth by EEC - Mandibular first molar.
Tooth with maximum surface involved in ECC - Upper central incisor.
ECC most commonly affects primary maxillary anterior dentition because these teeth erupt when child starts taking solid food and breast feeding.
The pattern of involvement of different surfaces in initial lesions of ECC shows that smooth surface lesion occurs more frequently than pit/fissure lesion.
Involvement of gingival third of crown precedes cervical region.
Lesions occur on proximal surfaces before distal surfaces.

Carisolv System

The Carisolv system consists of three solutions:

– A gel solution containing an organic solvent that dissolves the bacterial cell wall but does not affect tooth structure,
– An oxidizing agent to remove bacteria from the pulp chamber floor and walls, and
– A reducing agent to neutralize the oxidizer.

These agents work together with a special hand instrument called a “curette” which gently scrapes out infected tissue while leaving healthy tissues intact.
This technique has been shown to be effective in removing necrotic tissue without causing pulpal damage when compared to conventional methods using sodium hypochlorite alone.
It can also detect areas of demineralization within the enamel before they become visible radiographically.
In addition, it may help identify lesions at higher risk for progression"

D) Hopeless prognosis
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Prognosis is defined as an estimate of future outcome based on present conditions.

The Prognostic Factors

1. Root morphology (e.g., root length, width, curvature)
2. Periodontium status (i.e., attachment level, gingival health, periodontal disease extent)
3. Tooth position in relation to adjacent teeth and occlusion
4. Systemic/Environmental Conditions (e..g, smoking)

Classification of Prognosis:

Poor Prognoses

Advanced bone loss (>50% around most of the roots).
Grade II & III Furcations.
Tooth Mobility > 2 mm.
Systemic / Environmental Factors that cannot be controlled by treatment.
Hopeless Prognose

Any poor prognosed case with additional unfavorable factor such as:

Root Resorption.
Suppurative Periapical Lesion.
Pulp Exposure.
Severe Curvature of Roots.
Unrestorable Restorations.
Questionable Prognosises

Cases showing some favorable signs but also have some adverse features which may lead to failure if left untreated. These cases can be treated successfully if proper therapy is instituted at appropriate time. The presence of these questionable factors necessitates close monitoring of the condition over a long term basis.

### Response:
 g Ref : KD Tripathi Pharmacology 7th edition (page no; 467)
Hence, the correct answer is D (Sialorrhœa). (Ref: Goodman & Gilman's The pharmacological basis of therapeutics 12/e p214-215).
The most common side effects include nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, sleepiness, headache, sweating, changes in sexual desire or ability, weight gain or loss, diarrhea, rash, and yawning.Serotonin syndrome may occur when combined with other drugs that increase serotonin levels.Excessive doses can cause coma and death.
Hence it is important to know which drug has more chances of causing sialorrhea among antidepressants.
Amongst SSRIs, paroxetine causes maximum sialorrhrea followed by fluvoxamine and then citaloprom.
So, escitalopam doesnot have much chance of causing this symptom.

Zinc phosphate cement was introduced by G.V.Black in 1909. It consists of zinc oxide powder mixed with phosphoric acid liquid. 
It can also be prepared using stannous chloride instead of phosphorus acid. This type of cement is known as stannophosphate cement. 
Stannous fluoride may replace phosphorous acid to produce a more durable product called fluorozinc phosphate. 
In addition, zinc oxide-eugenol cements were developed later; they consist of zinc oxides mixed with eugenols. These materials set through an exothermic reaction between the two components.

Hence, the correct answer is B (A,C,D/B). (Ref: Ganong's physiology 23rd edition pg - 567)
Hence the correct Answer is B ((A,C.D)/B.). (Ref;Ganongs physiology 22nd ed/568). The first positive deflection in jugular venous pressure tracing represents atrial systole (the so-called ""a-wave""). It occurs when right ventricle begins to contract against closed tricuspid valve. This causes an increase in backpressure that pushes blood backward into the vena cavae during late diastole. During this time of increased back-pressure, the atria cannot empty themselves completely, which results in the characteristic x descent seen after the y descent. The second positive defleciion (""c"") reflects bulging of the tricuspiid valve toward the atrium at the onset of ventricular contraction. The third positive defiection (""v"") follows the rapid ejection of blood by the right ventricles into the aoae and pulmonary veins. As a result, there is decreased volume returning to the right atrium, causing it to fall below its resting level. Finally, the fourth positive defletion (""x"") indicates atrial filling"

The most common type of wound produced by explosive force is an incendiary burn pattern which can take on various forms depending upon the distance between victim and explosion site. The three types of patterns include flame burns, flash burns, and hot gas burns. Flame burns occur when clothing ignites due to heat generated by flames. Flash burns result from direct exposure to intense light and heat without actual contact with fire. Hot gases cause damage through conduction and radiation rather than burning. These wounds often have irregular shapes that do not follow anatomical structures. They also tend to be more severe at areas where air currents converge such as under the chin, behind the ears, and around the neck.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g D i.e., Phospho creatineQ - The immediate source of high-energy phosphates in muscle fibers during intense exercise (e.g. sprinting), when oxidative phosphorylation cannot keep pace with demand, is the hydrolysis of phosphocreatinine to form ADP & Creatine phosphate.- In skeletal muscle, there is an additional mechanism that allows it to generate large amounts of ATP very rapidly. This system involves the enzyme myosin kinase which catalyzes the reaction between adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine to produce adenosinediphosphate (ADP) plus creatine-phosphate. When this occurs, the free energy released from the breakdown of ATP can be used to drive another round of contraction. Thus, the amount of ATP available at times of peak activity may actually increase due to the regeneration of ATP from ADP + PCr. However, since both reactions require energy input, they do not contribute to net ATP production but rather act as buffers against depletion of intracellular ATP stores. These systems allow muscle cells to maintain their contractile function even under conditions where oxygen delivery is limited such as during anaerobic glycolytic metabolism.-
Hence, the correct answer is D (PhosphocREATINE)."

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g A i.e., 5HT3 antagonist Metoclopromide has anti emetic effect by antagonizing 5 HT3 receptorsQ (in addition to its direct cholinergic mechanism). It can be used in chemotherapy induced vomiting & post operative nausea & vomiting. - Chemotherapy induced vomiting is mainly mediated through CTZ located at vagal nerve terminals near nucleus tractus solitarius in medulla oblongata. This area also contains 5- HT3 receptor. Therefore drugs with high affinity for this receptor have been found effective against it. Drugs acting on 5-H3 receptor are Ondansetron, Granisetron etc. These agents act directly on CTZ without stimulating gastric motility. Other areas involved in chemotheraphy induced vomiting include NTS, Area Postrema & Vomiting center in brainstem. So these patients may require combination therapy including anticholinergics like Prochlorperazine, Promethazine, Hyoscine etc. that acts peripherally on GIT & CTZ. In contrast, postoperative vomiting occurs primarily because of irritation of stomach wall during surgery. Thus, drugs having both central & peripheral actions are more useful than those with pure central effects. The most impoant site responsible for post-operative"

### Response:
 gates of surgery p- 1209
Hence, the correct answer is C (Chlorine based compunds). (Ref: Gates of Surgery - P-1209)
The disinfectant used in blood spillage should be chlorine-based compound such as hypochlorite solution with an effective concentration of at least 1000 ppm available chlorine. The area must remain wet for at least ten minutes before it can be considered safe to walk upon. If there has been contact between body fluids and skin, hands should be washed thoroughly with soap and water after cleaning up spills.
Hence the correct Answer is C (Chlorinie based compounds).
Note : Bleach solutions containing sodium hypochioride have broad-spectrum activity against bacteria, viruses, fungi, spores, and mycobacteria. They also kill many protozoa, including Giardia lamblia cysts and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. However, they do not reliably destroy prions.

The treatment plan includes functional appliances such as activator, Bionator, Frankel’s appliance etc.

These functional appliances work on the principle that they produce forward growth of mandible which will help in correcting the overjet problem.
In addition to this, these functional appliances also have an effect on the eruption pattern of teeth. They cause earlier eruption of lower incisors than upper incisor thus helping in reducing the overbite problem.
However, it should always be kept in mind that functional appliances do not change the vertical dimension of occlusion. Therefore, if there is open bite due to excessive posterior facial height then functional"

Options:
A) Fentanyl
B) Etomidate
C) Ketamine
D) Dexmedetomidine
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. The agent that should be avoided in this case is dexmedetomidine which causes bradycardia by stimulating alpha-2 receptors. It can cause severe hypotension due to decrease in cardiac output. All the other drugs listed do not have such adverse effects. They may even increase blood pressure (Etomidate & ketamine).
Hence, the correct answer is D (Dexmedetomite). (Ref: Miller's Anesthesia 8th/1689; Morgan 5/e p1010)
The most common side effect associated with etomidate administration is myoclonus. This usually occurs within minutes after injection but rarely lasts more than one minute. Myoclonic movements occur in approximately 20% of patients receiving etomidates. These movements are generally benign and self-limited. However, they can interfere with endotracheal intubation and lead to laryngospasm. In rare cases, seizures have been repoed after etomidiate use. Seizures appear to result from high doses (>3 mg/kg), rapid boluses, concurrent barbiturates, and pre-existing seizure disorders.

### Response:
 g Septicemic Shock - It occurs when there is bacteremia with S.aureus. The bacteria enter into blood stream and cause septicemia. This can be seen in intravenous drug abusers who use contaminated needles to inject drugs. In this condition, patient presents with fever, chills, hypotension, tachycardia etc. There may also be presence of petechiae on the conjunctiva, soft palate, anterior chest wall and axilla.

Staphyloccocal food Poisoning

It is due to ingestion of preformed enterotoxin produced by staphylooocus aureus. Enterotoxins are heat stable proteins that have low molecular weight (molecular wt <30 kDa). They are responsible for causing nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps within half an hour after consumption of food containing these toxins. These symptoms last for few hours but do not recur. Foods commonly implicated include meat, poultry fish, potato salad, milk products such as custards, cream pastries, cheese and salads made up of potatoes, eggs, chicken, tuna or macaroni.

 g B (--45mv.) (Ref Ganong Physiology 22nd/pg. 685; Dhingra ENT 3rd/ pg. 6-7).ENDOCOCHLEAR POTENTIAL# The endocochlear potential of approximately -90 mv is generated by Na+K+-ATPase in the stria vascularis.# It drives K+ into the scala media through tight junctions between its epithelial cells.# This creates an electrical gradient that causes positive ions to flow out of the apex of hair cell stereocilia when they bend inward toward their cuticular plate.# Thus, bending of the hairs depolarizes them, reducing the difference between their membrane potentials and those of nearby supporting cells, which have no stereocilias. When this occurs, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels open allowing Ca++ influx into the hair cells causing exocytosis of synaptic vesicles containing glutamate at synapses with auditory nerve endings. Glutamate then acts on AMPA receptors on these nerves to cause excitation of the nervous system.Endolymphatic duct & sacEndolymph contains high concentration of potassium ionQIt has very low specific gravity compared to perilymph.It communicates with subarachnoid space via aqueduct of cochlea"

It has been described as ""a confusional state of disorientation, delusions, hallucinations, memory loss, and personality changes"". The symptoms may resemble those found in dementia but they do not persist after recovery from the underlying cause. Ganser's syndrome is characterized by three main features: approximate answers to questions (also called vorbeireden); clouding of consciousness; and visual or auditory hallucinations. These symptoms occur when there is damage to the frontal lobe of the brain. In some cases, patients will give approximate answers such as saying that two plus two equals five instead of four. This phenomenon is referred to as ""vorbeiredn"" which means literally ""to speak past something.""

Note : Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT): It is located near large blood vessels and along nerves. Its main function is to generate body heat when food intake is low. The cells of BAT resemble muscle fibers rather than those of white fat. They contain numerous mitochondria rich in lipase activity. When norepinephrine binds to receptors on these cells, they release fatty acids into their cytoplasm, which then undergoes oxidation within the mitochondria. This process produces heat instead of ATP. Thus, shivering can be replaced by activation of BAT during cold exposure.

Explanation: Thermogenic Effect of Food (TEF): The energy expended by body to process dietary nutrients into usable form is called TEF. It includes both basal metabolic rate(BMR) & physical activity level(PAL). TEF accounts for approximately 10% of total daily energy expenditure in sedentary individuals. There is increased BMR after consuming protein-rich foods compared to fat- rich foods. This phenomenon is known as ""thermogenesis"" or ""diet-induced thermogenesis"". Ref : Biochemistry By U. Satyanarayana 3rd edition Pgno : 101
Hence, the correct answer is A (Carbohydrates). (Ref: Textbook of biochemistry Dr JG Raju 6th Ed P502)

In general, it has been found that proteins produce more heat than carbohydrates and fats during digestion and absorption. For example, when fed at an equal caloric intake, a high-protein diet produces a greater increase in resting metabolism than does either carbohydrate or fat. However, this difference may be due to differences in digestibility rather than inherent differences between the three major classes of nutrient. That is, if all three were equally digestible, there"

Question: Which of the following is not a cause of Squamous cell Carcinoma for Head & Neck:
Options:
A) EBV
B) HPV
C) Betel Nut
D) Vitamin A
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. The etiology of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in head and neck region includes tobacco use, alcohol abuse, betel nut chewing, human papillomavirus infection, radiation exposure, and genetic factors such as p53 mutations. SCCs can be divided into two groups based on their clinical behavior: those that arise in patients with no history of heavy smoking or drinking; these tumors tend to have better prognosis than do aggressive lesions arising in smokers. These latter tumors often contain mutated TP53 genes and exhibit increased expression of cyclin D1 due to amplification of CCND1. In addition, they frequently show loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 9p21, which harbors CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene. Tumors without evidence of TP53 mutation may also occur but appear less common. Ref: Schwaz's principle of surgery 9th edition Chapter 39.
Hence, the correct answer is B (HPV). (Ref: Schwartz's principles of Surgery 9/e p484-485)The most impoant risk factor for development of HNSCC is Tobacco consumption followed by Alcohol intake.Alcohol acts synergistically with tobacco to increase cancer incidence.Tobacco contains more than 70 carcinogens including polyc"

B) Entamoeba
C) Staph
D) Clostridium perfringens
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. The presence of blood and mucus in the stool suggests an inflammatory process such as that caused by E histolytica. Inflammation can be confirmed by finding white cells (leukocytes) in the feces. A positive test for haptoglobin also indicates inflammation because this protein binds to free hemoglobin in the bloodstream but is removed when there is bleeding into tissues; it will therefore appear negative if red blood cells have been destroyed within tissue macrophages. Giardiasis does cause diarrhea, which may contain fat droplets (""floaters"") on examination of the stool sediment under the microscope. However, giardial infection usually causes chronic symptoms rather than acute ones, and there would generally be no evidence of inflammation. Staphylococcal food poisoning produces vomiting and watery diarrhea without blood or pus. It occurs after eating foods contaminated with staphyloccocal enterotoxin. Symptoms occur rapidly, often within four hours of ingestion of the toxin. They last less than six hours and resolve spontaneously. There is no role for antibiotics in treatment. C difficile colitis typically follows antibiotic therapy directed at another organism. Antibiotics kill off normal intestinal flora, allowing overgrowth of C difficle. This leads to production of toxins that damage mucosal"

### Response:
 growth of nose occurs in two stages first stage growth begins at bih and continues till age of 6-8 yrs second stage stas after pubey and ends between ages of 14 -16yrs ref : maheswari 9th ed
Hence, the correct answer is C (13 years). (Ref: Nelson's 20th edition; page no: 2800 table 2)
The most common cause of congenital malformations of the external nose is trauma during delivery. The incidence of this type of injury has been reported to be approximately 1% among all live births. Most often it results in a deviated septum with displacement of one side of the nose downward and outward. Other causes include genetic syndromes such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, Apert syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome, and hemifacial microsomia. Congenital absence of the nasal alae can occur due to failure of fusion of the frontonasal process with the maxillary prominence. This condition may also result in midline clefts of the upper lip and palate. Rarely, complete agenesis of the entire nose can occur. In addition, there have been reports of isolated cases of preaxial polyd"

Question: Phosphate bonded investment should be completely carbon free, otherwise:
Options:

D) Smooth casting
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 gutknecht phosphate bonded investments contain small amounts of organic binder that may include residual carbon residue from pyrolysis of some portion of the phosphoric acid used in their manufacture. The presence of this carbon can cause black discoloration on the surface of the finished casting due to oxidation during solidification of the alloy.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Black castings). (Ref: Phillips Science of Dental Materials ed 12th pg 204)
Phosphates have been widely used because they produce strong, durable molds with good dimensional stability at elevated temperatures. They also exhibit low thermal conductivity and high heat capacity. These characteristics make them suitable for use in precision casting equipment where long pouring times often occur. 
The primary disadvantage associated with these materials is that they require an extremely dry atmosphere to prevent moisture absorption by the setting mixture. This requirement necessitates the use of special drying procedures before application to the model. In addition, gutknechts’ phosphate-bonded investments contain relatively large quantities of water compared with plaster-of-paris-based products; therefore, they must be mixed slowly and thoroughly to avoid incorporation of air into the liquid phase. If properly prepared, however, these investments will set rapidly and harden within minutes after mixing.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Anti-HBC is an immunoglobulin G antibody that remains positive long after recovery from acute infection with Hepatitis B virus (HBV). It can be detected by ELISA test. The presence of anti-HBC indicates past exposure to HBV but does not indicate current active disease. Ref - pubmed.com
Hence, the correct answer is A (IgG Anti hbcAg). (Ref : Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 18th ed /pg no 2595)
The serologic markers used most commonly to diagnose viral hepatitis include:

• HBs Ag (hepatitis B surface antigen): This protein is produced on the surface of the hepatitis B virion and is detectable early in the course of infection. Its detection signifies active replication of the virus.

• IgM Ab to core Ag (anti-HBc; IgM anti-core): This antibody appears soon after appearance of HBs ag and disappears within several months. In contrast to HBsag, it is not protective against reinfection.

### Response:
 g
Explanation: Lactose Intolerance occurs when there is an inability of intestinal mucosa to absorb lactose due to lack of enzyme lactase (b-galactosidase). It can be caused by congenital absence of this enzyme in infants or acquired later in life d/t damage to small intestine. The symptoms occur after ingestion of milk containing more than 5% sugar. Symptoms include abdominal cramps, bloating, flatulence, loose stools etc. Treatment includes avoidance of such foods which contain high amount of lactose. Foods that do not require digestion of lactase are allowed like cheese, butter, skimmed milk powder, ice-cream, condensed milk, curd/yogurt, whey, casein, hydrolysed lactose, malted milks, dried fruits, fruit juices, meat & fish. Ref : Ghai essential pediatrics, eighth edition P.no: 150

c) NK cells secrete IFN-gamma to activate macrophage function.
d) IFN-alpha has antiviral activity whereas IFN-beta also activates immune responses.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Cd8). (+)ve selection occurs during thymic maturation when immature T-cells express either CD4 or CD8 but not both. The positive selection process ensures that mature T-cytokines will have an affinity for self-MHC proteins expressed on their surface. This means they can bind to these proteins without causing autoimmunity. Negative selection eliminates those T-cyto­kine precursors that react strongly with self-proteins. These would be autoreactive because they could attack normal body tissues. Thus, negative selection prevents autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid ahritis"

 g B i.e., Primary spermetocytes to secondary spematocytesSperm formation (spermiogenesis) is completed in seminiferous tubulesQ by process called spermiogenesis; it involves transformation of round spermatid into elongated mature spermatozoonQ.Sperms have no mitochondria but contain centrioles & acrosomeQ.Maternal contribution includes cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria, ribosomes etc.Paternal contributions include nuclear DNA, head cap & tail filaments.During meiosis I, homologus chromosomes pair up during prophase I forming bivalent chromosomes that separate during anaphase I so that daughter cells receive one set of chromosomes (haploid). During meiosis II sister chromatids separate resulting in two haploid gametes with identical sets of genes but different alleles. Meiosis I takes place in male germ cell between late pachytene & metaphase I stages of spermiogensis. It stas when primary spermtocytes divide to form secondary spermtocvtes. This division is unequal & results in smaller secondary speramtocytes containing most of genetic material & larger lacy residual bodies devoid of nuclei & cytoplasma. The second meiotic division begins after release of sperm"

Question: A 36 year old female is found to have a large pituitary mass on MRI imaging. She underwent transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. Postop replacement of which of the following hormone is not needed?
Options:
A) L-Thyroxine
B) Estradiol
C) Glucocoicoids
D) Mineralocoicoids
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Answer B. Estradiola. The patient in this case has undergone surgery for removal of a non-functioning adenoma (non-secretory). Replacement therapy with hormones that were being secreted by the tumor would be required postoperatively. In females who undergo surgical resection of an ACTH secreting pituitarv tumour, mineralocoicoid replacement may also be necessary because of loss of feedback inhibition of renin release due to low circulating levels of cortisol. Patients undergoing treatment for prolactinomas require lifelong dopamine agonist therapy after initial medical or surgical management. Treatment of patients with acromegaly involves long-term pharmacologic suppression of GH secretion using somatostatin analogues or dopamine agonists; if these measures fail, surgical ablation of the pituitayr adenoma can be performed. Surgical excision of a functioning TSH-secreting pituitarv adenoma results in permanent cure of hyperthyroidism. However, thyroid hormone replacement should still be initiated peri-operatively until normal serum free-T4 concentrations are achieved. If there was no evidence of preoperative hypehyroidism, then it is unlikely that she will need thyroxine replacement postoperativelv. Prolonged glucocorticoid supplementation is recommended"

Hence B is incorrect
Explanation: Permissive actions of Hormones

Some hormones do not directly stimulate target cells to increase their activity; instead they simply allow them to respond more readily to stimulation by another agent.

For example, thyroid hormones enhance the sensitivity of skeletal muscle fibers to acetylcholine released from motor nerve endings, thereby increasing contraction force without changing the number of receptors on the fiber surface. Similarly, adrenal glucocorticoids sensitize adipose tissue to epinephrine, which stimulates lipolysis, and estrogen sensitizes breast epithelium to prolactin, which promotes lactation. In these cases, the effectors are said to be under ""permissive control"" of the hormones involved.


In some instances, however, the term permissive action is used loosely"

 g C i.e., Ganglionic cell
Hence, the correct answer is C (Ganglion cells). (""Optic nerve head"" by Hayreh p- 7; ""Ophthalmology - A Pocket Textbook Atlas"" By Ramanjit Sihota & Radhika Sharma page 120). Optic disc changes occur due to loss of ganglion cellsQ. The earliest change is thinning of neuroretinal rim followed by pallor of disc which occurs before visual field defects appear. In severe cases cupping develops with progressive enlargement of physiological cup. This may be associated with baring of vessels over edge of disc. Retina shows no significant abnormality except for localized areas of retinal pigment epithelium mottling around blood vessels near the disc. Macular region remains normal till late stages when diffuse macular pigmentation becomes apparent. Visual acuity is usually maintained until advanced stage of disease. Field defect first involves peripheral fields and progresses gradually towards central vision. Central scotoma is characteristic feature of long standing glaucoma.

The cochleovestibular nerve arises in the spiral ganglion of Corti within the scala media of the cochlea; its fibres pass through the internal acoustic meatus into the lateral wall of the posterior cranial fossa. It then divides into two branches - vestibular and cochlear nerves. These enter the pons on either side of the inferior cerebellar peduncles and ascend together in the brainstem until they reach their respective nuclei. The cochlear fibres end mainly in the dorsal and ventral divisions of the superior olivary complex, but some also terminate directly upon the medial geniculates bodies. Some fibres cross over immediately after entering the medulla oblongata while others do so higher up in the midbrain.

### Response:
 g D i.e., Continue sodium Valproate (VPA) with regular monitering of serum levelQ - Sodium valprote can be used in pregnancy but it has teratogenic potential & should be avoided if possible. It causes neural tube defects like spina bifida & craniofacial abnormalities. However, when seizures are severe enough that they pose risk to mother's life during preganancy then VPA may have to be continued. In such cases, folic acid supplementation must be staed before conception & continued throughout first trimester. Serum concentration of drug needs to be monitored regularly because its protein binding capacity decreases in pregnancy leading to increased free fraction of drug which increases toxicity. Lamotrigene is also safe in pregnancy; however, there is no evidence that it reduces incidence of major malformations. Carbomazapine crosses placenta more than VPA & cause fetal hydantoin syndrome characterized by cleft lip, cleft palate, microcephaly, hypoplastic phalanges etc. Therefore, it is contraindicated in pregnancy.

The pH is slightly acidic (normal range is 7,25 - 7,44). This indicates that there must be some metabolic cause leading to decrease in bicarbonate level.
So it's an example of metabolic acidosis.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Metabolic acidasis). (Ref : Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine,18th edition,pg no.365)
Hence the correct Answer is B ((Metabolic Acidosis.). (Ref: Harrison's Principle of internal medicine, 18/e pg 366 table 47-1).
Note: In all cases where we have to find out whether its metabolic or respiratory disorder, always remember that if pH <7.36 then it will be acidosis and if >7.40 then it is alkalosis.
If CO2 level increases then it means respiratory system is involved otherwise metabolic system is responsible.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g HARRISON'S INTERNAL MEDICINE-18TH EDITION,PG NO;3242 Maternal transmission is seen in mitochondrial diseases because mitochondria are inherited solely through maternal lineage. The mother transmits her entire mitochondrial genome to all of her offspring (sons and daughters), whereas fathers transmit their mitochondria only to their daughters. Therefore, if either parent harbors a pathogenic mtDNA mutation, it will be transmitted to subsequent generations almost exclusively by mothers who carry that mutation. In contrast, paternal transmission occurs with Y-linked disorders such as fragile X syndrome, which is caused by mutations on the long arm of chromosome Y. Because males do not inherit an X chromosome, they cannot pass on an X-linked disease gene to their sons. However, since females can inherit both an X and a Y sex chromosome, there is no gender bias in the transmission of autosomal dominant traits. With autosomal recessives, however, there may be a gender preference in the expression of some phenotypes due to differences between men and women in penetrance and expressivity. For example, sickle cell trait is more common among African Americans than whites, reflecting higher rates of heterozygosity for this disorder within the black population. Nonetheless, when individuals with sickle-cell trait intermarry"

### Response:
 g A i.e., Antegrage Amnesia
Hence, the correct answer is A (Antegrade Amnesia). (Ref: Kaplan & Sadock's Synopsis of Psychiatry, Xth edition, pg no. 1055-1060).
The most frequent side effects of electroconvulsive therapy include headache, nausea, muscle ache, dizziness, confusion, memory loss, and sleep disturbance. The risk of permanent cognitive impairment after ECT has been estimated to be less than 1% in patients with severe depression who have failed pharmacotherapy. Memory disturbances can occur during treatment but usually resolve within weeks to months posttreatment. Seizure threshold reduction may result in status epilepticus; this occurs rarely (<1%) when using standard doses of E.C.T. Other complications such as fractures, injuries, aspiration pneumonia, arrhythmias, intracranial hemorrhages, and death are rare. - www.medscape.com
ECT causes anterograde amnesia which means that patient forgets all events occurring before the onset of illness plus those occurring between the time of first seizure and recovery phase.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Option c (Heaving shifted Apex) is correct because in Aortic stenosis there will be left ventricular hyperophy which causes heaving type of apical impulse to shift towards axilla.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Heving shifted apex). Explained below :
In patients with severe AS, LVF develops due to increased afterload → Left ventricle becomes hypertrophied & dilated → The apex shifts laterally toward the mid-axillary line.
Pulse

The pulse pressure increases in all forms of valvular AS but it is more marked when Aoic valve is involved.

Systolic murmur

It begins late in systole and has diamond shape i.e., It starts soft, then crescendos, decrescendo and ends softly.
It radiates along upper part of sternum and carotids.
It may be associated with thrill.
Ejection sound

An ejection sound occurs at beginning of systole just after the first heart sound.
This sound results from sudden opening of the semilunar valves during systole.

### Response:
 gates of medical statistics 8th edition page no-7, ref : Park's textbook of preventive and social medicine 24 th Edition
Hence, the correct answer is A (Interval/Ratio Scale). (Ref: Gates of Medical Statistics 8/e p6; Park PSM 23rd ed/p9)
The mean and median cannot both exist at the same time in a distribution unless the values are measured on an interval/ratio scale.
Mean and Standard Deviation

These two measures of central tendency and dispersion respectively require that the observations should have been made using ratio scales.

For example, we could measure blood pressure by taking readings with sphygmomanometer which would give us reading in mm Hg - a true zero point exists and equal intervals between successive units.
We could also count the number of cigarettes smoked per day but this measurement does not meet these criteria because there is no true zero value and therefore it is not possible to determine whether one person smokes twice as many cigarettes as another.
In addition, the measurements must be quantitative rather than qualitative. For example, while we might know how often people smoke, drink alcohol etc., we do not know anything about their quality of life so these variables will not allow calculation of means and SDs.

### Response:
 g C i.e., Pulmonary Hypoplasa
Hence, the correct answer is C (Pulmonary hypoplasis). Congenital Diaphramatic Hernias - CDH occurs when there is an opening in the diaphragm that allows abdominal organs to move into the chest cavity. This can put pressure on developing lungs and make it difficult for them to expand properly after bih. Most babies with this condition have underdeveloped lungs (pulmonary hypeension), which makes breathing very hard. In fact, pulmonary hypeension is usually responsible for most deaths associated with CDH. Other complications include sepsis, bleeding, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and intestinal malrotation. Infants born with CDHR may also experience problems such as feeding difficulties, poor weight gain, rapid heabeating, cyanosis, tachypnea, apneic spells, acidosis, lethargy, and bradycardia. These symptoms occur because their lung tissue does not develop normally during pregnancy. As a result, they do not get enough oxygen through normal respiration. They need help breathing immediately after birth. Treatment includes mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

### Response:
 g McRoberts maneuver is used to reduce dislocated hips in obstetrics. The patient's legs are flexed at the hip and knees and pulled up toward her abdomen. This can be done by having you hold your own leg while she leans forward. If this does not work, we may need to use sedation or anesthesia to help relax the muscles around the joint.

 g Option (a) i.e., Diabetes mellitus is correct because diabetes can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The risk of developing type II diabetes increases if more than one family members have the disease. Other complications seen with IDDM are retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy etc.
Hence, the correct answer is A (DM). Explained text : Infants whose mothers had gestational diabetes during pregnancy may develop low blood sugar at bih. This condition usually goes away within days without treatment. Babies also may grow too large before birth (macrosomia), which can increase risks related to delivery. Children who were exposed to high levels of insulin while they were still growing inside their mother's womb may be at increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes later on. Women with pre-existing diabetes should work closely with their healthcare provider to manage their blood glucose level throughout their pregnancy. They need regular prenatal care that includes frequent urine tests to check for ketones and blood sugar monitoring.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. The angle subtends at the nodal point of the eye by the smallest line (2 mm width) of the Snellenscha is one minute of arc. This corresponds to normal vision with an acuity of 5/5. In practice, however, this means that there must be no refractive error greater than +/- 0.25 D spherical equivalent; otherwise, the image will fall outside the fovea centralis. If such errors exist, then the patient has to use his accommodation to focus correctly. As long as he can do so without fatigue, visual acuity may still be good enough to read up to 3 lines smaller than normal. However, if the accommodative power falls short, the patient cannot see better than 20/200. Therefore, patients with presbyopia should have their refraction corrected before they reach age 40 years. Otherwise, they would need glasses even when looking straight ahead because of their reduced ability to accommodate. A similar situation exists in children younger than 7-8 yr old, whose eyes often require correction but whom parents refuse to give spectacles. These children also suffer from poor near vision due to uncorrected hypermetropia. It is impoant to note that the size of the"

Hence, the correct answer is C (Salivation on smell of food). (Ref: Ganong's physiology 23rd/ed pg 25-26; Guyton & Hall textbook of medical physiology 12th edition page no 1009)
Hence salivary secretion occurs when we see food due to feedforward control.
Feed Forward Control

In this type of feedback control there is no change in stimulus before it has occurred but instead an action is taken that will prevent future changes.

Example:

When you look at your favorite dish, saliva starts flowing into your mouth even though you have not yet eaten anything. This anticipatory reflex helps prepare your digestive system for eating by increasing the flow of water and enzymes into your stomach and small intestine. The same thing happens if someone smells something delicious. In both cases, the sensory input causes increased activity in neurons that project directly onto motor nerves innervating muscles involved in digestion. These include smooth muscle fibers in the walls of the gastrointestinal tract and glands within its mucosa. As these muscles contract, they cause more fluid and secretions to be released into the lumen of the gut. Thus, the nervous system can anticipate events such as meals based solely upon visual cues like seeing food or olfactory stimuli like smelling"

Hence, the correct answer is D (Acute viral myocarditis). (Ref : Ghai essential of pediatrics, eighth edition,p.no., 356-357 ). Viral infections can cause acute inflammatory myopathy in children. The most common clinical presentation is weakness that develops over several hours to weeks. Fever may be present at onset; however, it usually resolves within 1 week. Pain in affected muscles is often severe. Laboratory studies reveal an elevated creatine kinase level (>100 times upper limit of normal), whereas electromyography shows evidence of myopathic changes. Muscle biopsy reveals mononuclear cell infiltration into endomysium and perimysium. Recovery occurs spontaneously after 2 months. Treatment consists of symptomatic care until recovery ensues.

HLA-A,B,C genes located on short arm of chromosome 6.
Class II molecule consists of an alpha chain & beta chain linked together by disulfide bond.
These are expressed mainly on antigen presenting cell like macrophages, dendritic cells, b lymphocytes but can be induced to express on activated T-cells, monocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts etc.
The most important function of these molecules is to bind peptide fragments of foreign proteins that have been degraded inside the cell & display them on their surface so that they may interact with CD4+ helper T-cell receptors.
They are encoded by three separate loci namely DP,DQ,& DR which map close to one another on short limb of chromosome six.

### Response:
 g B i.e., Greater Petrosal NerveGreater superficial petrosa! nerve (GSPN), also called greater petrosus branch of facial nerveQ arises in geniculate ganglion & runs forwards through middle cranial fossa along lateral wall of cavernous sinus with trigeminal division of Vth nerve; it pierces dura mater at superior orbital fissure & joins lacrimatory gland forming nerve to lacrymal gland.Q It carries preganglionic parasympathetic fibres that synapse in lacrimal glands to produce watery secretion necessary for lubrication of eye ball during blinking movement. Postganglionic secretomotor fibers pass via zygomaticotemporal branch of maxillary nerve to reach lacrimate gland. Therefore lesion of GSN causes dry eyes (Xerophthalmia). Lesion of nasociliary Q nerve leads to loss of corneal sensations causing keratopathy. The anterior ethmoidal nerve provides sensory innervation to medial pa of upper eyelid, frontal skin & conjunctiva. Its block can cause watering of eye but this will be unilateral whereas lesion of greater petorsal nerve results in bilateral watering of eyes.

D) Low 'C'peptide level
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g
Hence, the correct answer is B (Hepatic stea tosis). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 18th edition pg 3109-3110 table 356-1)
Hence Insulin Resistance occurs due to hepatic Steatosis which leads to decreased uptake of glucose by Liver cells.
Insulin sensitivity can be increased with exercise & weight loss.
The most common cause of hyperinsulinaemia is obesity.
Hyperglycemia causes an increase in glucagon levels that stimulates gluconeogenesis.
In type II DM there is reduced expression of GLUT -2 on hepatocytes leading to impaired Glucose uptake into the cell.
Type I DM has no defect in insulin action but rather results from absolute deficiency of functional pancreatic beta-cells.
Harrison writes ""Insulin resistance may also occur secondary to chronic alcohol abuse, drugs such as steroids, HIV infection, hemochromatosis, acanthocytosis, and lipodystrophy"".
Hence it is clear that Insulin Resistant states lead to Hyperinsulinemia.

B) 26
C) 32
D) 25
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g = mean ±2SD covers 95 % values
Hence, the correct answer is A (28). (Ref : Parson's disease of eye -20th edition pg-21)
Hence B i.e. 26 cannot be used to calculate the value of IOP at 95%. The formula g=mean±2sd will give us the range within which we expect our data points to fall 95 percent of time. So if we take the mean as 30mm Hg and standard deviation as 10 then the limits would be between 20 and 40 mm Hg. This means that 95 out of every 100 people who have their blood pressures measured should have readings falling within this range. In case of normal curve, it follows bell shaped pattern so there is equal chance on either side of the mean. Therefore, when we say 95%, it includes both sides of the graph. Hence, the answer here is 28 because 28 lies below the mean and also falls under the 95%.
Hence the correct ans is A(28). Ref : parsons' diseases of eyes 20/e p21

### Response:
 g. (Xenon-133 is used in this technique).Anatomic Dead Space - The volume of air that moves into the respiratory passages but does not take part in gas exchange; it includes the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, terminal alveolar ducts, and most of the respiratory acinus. It can be calculated using either the single-breath N2 washout curve or xenon- 133 dilution techniques. In normal subjects, anatomic dead-space volumes range between 150 ml and 200 mL. Alveolar ventilation = tidal volume - dead space volume. Physiologic Dead Space : This represents all parts of the lung where blood flow occurs without adequate matching with ventilation. Therefore physiologic dead space equals to anatomical deadspace + Shunt volume. A shunt exists when there is no perfusion of pulmonary capillaries yet ventilation still occurs. For example, atelectasis, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, ARDS, etc. may cause shunting. Normal values for physiological dead space ranges from 100mL to 120mL. **Physiological dead space increases with age due to loss of elasticity of lungs & chest wall**. *The difference between Vital capacity and Inspiratory reserve volume gives"

Hence, the correct answer is D (Liver function tests). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 18th/Chapter 171e.)Tuberculoma can cause raised intracranial tension which may be precipitated by steroids used to treat tuberculomas. This will lead to papilledema & blurring of disc margins. So if there is no improvement after starting antituberculous therapy it should raise suspicion of tuberculoma formation.

The term ""hydrocolloids"" refers to materials that contain colloidal particles suspended within another substance, usually water. Hydrocolloidoses are classified according to whether they form gels when exposed to heat or light. When heated, these substances change from liquids to solids. They return to their solid-to-liquid states upon cooling. These changes occur reversibly with no loss of material properties. Thus, hydrocolloides have been used extensively in various applications such as photography, adhesives, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food products, dental impression making, and medical imaging.

Explanation: The epiphyseal plate ossifies completely at different times depending on the long bones involved. For example, the distal femur fuses between ages 14-16 years; the proximal tibia fuses around age 17 years; and the distals of the radius and ulna fuse between ages18-20 years. In addition, there may be some variation in skeletal maturity within individuals due to differences in nutrition, health status, genetics, etc. Therefore, it can be difficult to determine exact chronological age based solely upon skeletal development.

 g B i.e., FetusFetal urine accounts for approximately 40% of amniotic fluids volumeQ at term (35-37 weeks). The remainder comes from transudation across fetal skin & placental membranes; maternal kidneys contribute very little to it.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Fetus). (Ref: William's Obstetrics, 22nd edition, page 120)
Amniotic Fluid Volume

### Response:
 g Vasomotor Reversal of Dale (Vasoconstriction to Vessel Relaxation)
The effect of adrenergic agonists on blood vessels is dependent upon the relative concentration of α and β receptors in that vessel. If there are more α receptors than β receptors, then the net result will be vasoconstrictor activity; if there are fewer α receptors, the net effect will be vasodilator activity. This concept was first described by H.H.Dale who called it ""vasomotor reversibility"". It has been shown experimentally using isolated rabbit ear artery preparation where noradrenaline produces vasocontriction at low concentrations but causes relaxation at high concentrations. The same observation holds good with adrenaline also. 
Ref : KD Tripathi pharmacology 7th edition page no 120
Hence, the correct answer is C (Stimulation of α-1 followed by block of β-2). (Ref: KDT 6/e p119).
Explanation: Vasomotion refers to spontaneous rhythmic fluctuations in diameter of resistance arteries. These changes occur due to contraction-relaxation cycles of smooth muscle cells within the wall of these vessels. Vasomotors refer to substances which cause such fluctuation"

### Response:
 g Microorganism causes inflammation in apical tissues.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Microorganisms). (Ref: Textbook of endodontics - K Sreedhar 2nd edtn pg-10)
The inflammatory process may be divided into three phases:

Phase I

This phase begins with bacterial invasion of the pulp space through the dentinal tubules.

Phase II

In this stage, there occurs an intense infiltration of leukocytes that attempt to eliminate bacteria and necrotic debris. The microorganisms produce enzymes such as collagenase, hyaluronidase, proteases, lipases, phospholipases, fibrinolytic agents, etc., which cause liquefaction of the surrounding connective tissue. This results in formation of pus within the pulp chamber and root canals. If the infection spreads beyond the confines of the tooth, it produces swelling and pain. When the pressure becomes too great, the infected material is extruded out of the apex of the root at the site where the blood vessels enter the pulp. This leads to development of acute periradicular abscess. Sometimes, if the opening is blocked by granulation tissue, the pus collects around the apex forming parasternal cysts.

Phase III

### Response:
 g. Feed forward control refers to an increase in insulin secretion before blood glucose levels rise (e.g., after eating). It occurs because there is increased activity of nerves that synapse with pancreatic b cells; this causes them to release more insulin into the bloodstream. The effect on lowering blood sugar level is rapid, occurring within minutes. This type of feedback mechanism helps prevent excessive increases in blood glucose concentration during digestion.Ref: Guyton & Hall textbook of medical physiology-13th edition, page no: 1011
Hence, the correct answer is B (Insulin). (Ref: Guytons Physiology Review - 11th ed ch: 38)Feed-forward mechanisms refer to those processes whereby changes in one system influence another system without requiring input from sensory receptors.Feedback mechanisms refer specifically to situations where output from a system influences its own inputs.Insulin secretion provides a good example of both types of regulation.The rate at which insulin is secreted depends upon several factors including plasma glucose concentrations, amino acid availability, free fatty acids, epinephrine, norepinephrine and glucagon.Plasma glucose stimulates insulin secretion through two separate pathways.One pathway involves direct stimulation of beta cell membrane depolarization via closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels.Another pathway involves activation of"

### Response:
 gypsum bonded investments have two components : powder & liquid. when mixed, it forms paste which is poured into mold to set.
the thicker the mixture more is its viscosity ( less fluidity ) - so that it can hold shape better in mold but may lead to porosity on surface.
thinner the mixture lower is its viscosity ( higher fluidity ). this helps in filling all corners of mold without voids but may result in loss of details due to flow out of material during pouring.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Increase setting expansion). (- ref K.S.Narayan reddy 21st ed page no- 55).

### Response:
 g Cross-infection can be minimized by using disposable bite-blocks or covering them with an imperviously coated material between patients.

Ref : Textbook of Orthodontics Gurkeerat Singh 2nd ed page no 8
Hence, the correct answer is D (Cover with impertuous barrier). (∵ Cross-contamination occurs when microorganisms are transferred directly or indirectly from one person to another or from one site on the body to another.). However, it should also be kept in mind that disposable biteblocks may reduce risk of transmission but do not eliminate this possibility because they have been shown to harbor bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans.
The American Dental Association recommends that dental practitioners follow guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which include proper sterilization procedures for all equipment used during treatment. The CDC has stated that there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine disinfection of radiographic film holders or intraoral cameras; however, these items must still meet standard precautions recommended by OSHA.

 g. Rhabdoymsarcomas arise in soft tissues but may also occur within the orbit. The most common site is the paramedian poion of the muscle cone. It occurs more commonly between ages 2-6 years. Proptosis is usually associated with painless swelling. On microscopic examination it shows sheets of undifferentiated cells that have variable amounts of cytoplasm. Immunostaining reveals positivity to desmin which confirms its origin from skeletal muscles.

### Response:
  - The above clinical scenario describes an acute exacerbation of Asthma which requires immediate management.
  - Management includes administration of oxygen (Oxygen supplementation), Bronchodilators (Salbutamol / Terbutaline).
  – If there is no improvement in symptoms after initial treatment, then intubation should be considered.

Option B – Nasal cannula can deliver up to 44% O2 at flow rates >6L/min. So it may help improve hypoxemia but does not address hypercapnia.
Option C – Controlled mechanical ventilation would lead to barotrauma due to high peak inspiratory pressures required during such ventilations.

 g protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)
Hence, the correct answer is A (Muscarinic m3 receptor). (Ref: Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics 10th/Ch.12; Katzung 11/e p101-102).
Hence the correct Answer is C (Serotonin 6HT1 receptor). Ref : Goodman & Gillmans 10/e pg 1079
Note - All muscaranic acetylcholine receptors except M3 are GPCRs which open K+ channel. So M3 acts by increasing Ca++ influx.
All dopamine receptors except D4 are GPCR which opens K+channel so D4 increases cAMP production.
Angiotensine II type I receptor causes increase in IP3-DAG system to release intracellular calcium.
Hence all these receptors do not cause opening of K+channels.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Height = (2/3) x Length of Humerus + 6
Hence, the correct answer is D (146 cm). (Ref : Reddy 33rd edition pg 7)
Hence B i.e. 110cm
Explanation: Height = (1.73 -0.05x Age) in cms
Age can be calculated by using formulae :
Age = (-9.03+ 8.02 x Lm /Lf )- 0.53
Where,
Lf = Femur length
Lm = Mid tibial length
Femur length = 30% of total body length
Mid tibia length =20 % of total length
Total body length = Humeral length + 10%
So, femur length= 0.3 x humeral length
And mid tibia = 0..2 x humerl length
Thus age = (- 9.04 + 8.02 x 0..3 x h / 0...2 xh)- 0...53
Age =(- 9.04 +2.40 x h)/ 0....16

### Response:
 g
Explanation: The normal value of Anion Gap (AG)=12-16 meq/l It can be calculated by subtracting the sum of sodium & potassium ions from that of chloride & bicarbonate ions in plasma. AG=(Na+K)-(Cl-HCO3-) In this case, it comes out to be 8meq/1 which falls within the range of normal values. So there is no high anion-gap metabolic acid-base disorder present here. Ref : Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine,18th Edition, Page 356
Hence, the correct answer is C (No acid base abnormalities). (Ref: Harrison's 19/e p354 table 46-5)

Hyperkalemias associated with chronic kidney disease may result from decreased excretion of potassium due to reduced GFR, increased secretion of potassium into tubular fluid secondary to hypokalemic nephropathy, or impaired cellular uptake of potassium caused by intracellular acidosis. Patients who have acute exacerbations of chronic kidney injury often develop severe hyperkalemic acidosis because they cannot compensate for their acid production by increasing ammonium ion excretion. Acidemia also impairs insulin-mediated transcellular shifts of"

Question: Purpose of giving Glycopyrrolate before GA
Options:
A) Decrease laryngeal secretions
B) Muscle relaxation
C) Prevents aspiration
D) Provides analgesia
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g
Hence, the correct answer is A (Decrease lARYNGEAL SECRETIONS). (Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th/ep-1019)
Hence it is option A that is ""Decrease LARYNGEAL SECRETION"" which is most appropriate here because glycopyrollate decreases all types of secretion including bronchial & tracheobronchial secretions but its main use in decreasing laryngotracheal secretations to prevent postoperative hoarseness.
Glycopyrrole is an anticholinergic drug used along with anaesthetic agents like succinyl choline to decrease the incidence of intra operative bradycardia caused by this agent.
It also prevents muscarinic side effects such as salivation, sweating etc.

Note : Atropine has similar action on these receptors but it can cause tachycardias whereas glycopyrrollate doesnot have cardiac effect due to lack of CNS penetration.
Hence the correct Answer is A ((decrease laryngeo-tracheo-bronchial Secretion). Ref: Miller Textbook of Anaesthesia -7th ed pno:1020

### Response:
 g RNA editing is done by 3' - 5' exonuclease activity of enzyme RNase H & D.
Hence, the correct answer is C (RNA editing). (Ref : Harper's illustrated biochemistry 30th ed page no- 404)
DNA REPAIR OCCURS IN 5’ – 3’
DNA REPLICATION OCCUR IN 3 ‘– 5’
TRANSCRIPTION OCCUR IS 5‘—> 3'
RNA EDITING OCCUR BY 3‘ —> 5’

Note :
The direction of synthesis of both leading strand and lagging strands is always 5′ to 3′.
In transcription, mRNA is synthesized in 53 → 35 direction i.e., 5→3 direction.
During translation, protein synthesis occurs from N terminal end towards carboxy-terminal end i.e.. 55 end to 33 end.

### Response:
 g C i.e., Grey
Hence, the correct answer is C (Grey). (Ref: Nelson's Textbook of Pediatrics 20th edition Page 1019; Ghai Essential pediatrics 8/e p 210-211)In this child grey color is seen which indicates that it is an IV line & can be used to give fluid therapy.In children who have severe dehydration, aggressive rehydration should begin immediately using isotonic saline or Ringer lactate solution at rates up to 100 mL/kg per hour until clinical improvement occurs. The goal of initial resuscitation is restoration of intravascular volume and hemodynamic stability. This may require administration of large amounts of crystalloid solutions during first few hours of treatment. In general, if there has been no clinical improvement after 30 minutes of rapid hydration, then reassessment of diagnosis must occur. If signs of shock persist despite adequate fluid replacement, blood transfusion should be considered. Once the infant begins to show evidence of improved perfusion, such as increased urine output (>1mL/ kg/hour), capillary refill <2 seconds, skin turgor >1 second, and warm extremities, maintenance fluids should be initiated.

### Response:
 g) The most important complication of paralytic disease is respiratory insufficiency due to diaphragmatic involvement. This may be fatal if mechanical respiration is not instituted early.
Hence, the correct answer is D (Respiratory failure). Explanation: Acute Polio Myelitis - It occurs when anterior horn cells of spinal cord & brainstem nuclei are involved. - Involvement of phrenic nerve results in bilateral diaphramatic weakness leading to respiratory distress which can prove fatal. - Death usually occur within few days after onset of symptoms. - Recovery begins with return of power in lower extremities followed by upper limbs. - Complete recovery takes place in majority of cases but residual disability remains in some patients. - Prognosis depends on the extent of motor neuron involvement : - If less than half of all motor neurons are affected, full recovery will follow. - With greater degree of involvement, there is more likelihood of residual deficit. - Paralysis of bulbar musculature carries poor prognosis because it indicates extensive damage to cranial nerves innervating face, neck flexors, tongue, swallowing mechanism etc. - Bulbar palsy also has high moality rate due to aspiration pneumonia.

### Response:
 g. The diagnosis of follicular adenoma is based on histological examination of resected specimen. It cannot be made by cytology alone because it may show capsular invasion & vascular space invasion which occurs in both benign & malignant lesions. So definitive treatment plan should always include total/ near-total thyroidectomy regardless of preoperative FNA results. - Schwartz 9/e p1362
Hence, the correct answer is B (Follicular carcinomas). (Ref : Sabiston 20th edition pg 892-893)
Note : The diagnosis of papillary cancer is usually confirmed with fine needle aspiration biopsy; however, this test has limited value when used to differentiate between well-differentiated tumors that have no extra-thyroidal extension and those that do. In addition, an aspirate showing abundant colloid does not exclude invasive disease. Therefore, even if the preoperative biopsy suggests papillary carcinoma, intraoperative frozen-section evaluation of the tumor capsule is recommended before finalizing the extent of surgery. – Schwaz 10e pg 1388

### Response:
 g Serum FSBhuiyan et al. (2009) have discussed that serum FSH level can be used to distinguish between obstructive and nonobstructive causes of azoospemia. ""Serum FSH concentration may help to determine whether azoopermia results from an intrinsic defect within the gonads or from some form of obstruction along the reproductive tract. In men with congenital absence of the vasa efferentia, seminal vesicles, epididymis, ejaculatory ducts, or prostate gland, spermatozoa will still be present in the seminiferous tubules; therefore, their FSH concentrations should be low because inhibin B produced by Sertoli cells suppresses pituitary secretion of FSH. On the contrary, if there is no spermatogenesis, then FSH would remain high due to lack of inhibition.""
Hence, the correct answer is A (Serum FSF). (Dr. Nandkishore Patil - Textbook of Gynaecology). Serum FHS is elevated in cases of primary hypogonadism (testicular failure), while it is decreased in secondary hypogondal patients (vas deferens obstrution).

Hence, the correct answer is A (Increasedactivity of liporotein lipaseand decreased activityof hormone sensitivelipase). (Ref: Harper's Biochemistry; 28th edition; Page No- 215)In type II DM there is increased TGs level which leads to increase in VLDl formation by liver. This process is mediated through an enzyme called LPL that hydrolyzes TGs present on chylomicrons and VDL. The rate limiting step in this reaction is catalyzed by Apo C-II. There is decrease in apo-CII concentration in patients with Type I1DM leading to reduced breakdown of TGs resulting in hypertriglyceridemia.Increase in free fatty acids released from adipose tissue also contributes to high TGs levels in blood stream.Hormone-sensitive lipase causes release of FFAs from fat cells. Its activity increases in diabetic state contributing to hyperglycemia.

 greatest value is changed to lesser value (i.e., 85 becomes 58), then both mean & median decreases.
Hence, the correct answer is A (Increased mean, Decreased median). (Ref: Park's Textbook of PSM 25th Ed; Pgno: 852)
The greatest value is altered to lower value (e.g. 85 changes to 58).
Then,
Mean → Decreases
Median → Increases
So, Mean < Median
Thus, it follows positively skewed distribution.

Skewness can be determined graphically using histogram or frequency polygon.

Types of Skewed Distribution:

Positive / Right-skewed/Right-tailed Positive skewness occurs when the majority of data points are concentrated on the left side of the distribution but there is a long tail extending out toward the right side.

### Response:
 g. Stopping Blood Transfusion (BT) immediately will prevent further complications like acute renal failure due to hemolysis caused by incompatible blood components. The most common cause of an adverse reaction during blood component therapy is allergic reactions. Allergic reactions can be immediate type I hypersensitivity reactions or delayed-type immune-mediated reactions. Immediate reactions occur within minutes after administration of blood products and include urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, hypotension, and rarely anaphylaxis. Delayed reactions may present hours to days after exposure and include fever, rigors, myalgias, ahralgia, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, fatigue, weakness, malaise, skin rashes, thrombocytopenic purpura, leukopenia, and rare cases of serum sickness. These symptoms usually resolve spontaneously without treatment but if severe they should be managed symptomatically. If there is no improvement then desensitization protocol must be initiated. In this scenario since it's been mentioned that she was complaining of pain while receiving blood transfusion which indicates possible intra-vascular hemolytic event so we need to stop the blood transfustion immediately and investigate the same.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g) The scaphoid bone is one of eight carpal bones in the human hand that forms the proximal row of the carpus (wrist). It has an unusual blood supply which makes it prone to fractures; these can be difficult to treat because they may fail to heal properly. The scapoid bone also plays a key role in maintaining the shape of the back of the hand. In addition, its position allows it to act as a pivot point when rotating the forearm into pronation and supination. The name ""scaphoid"" comes from Greek σκάφος (skáphos), meaning boat-shaped.[1] The word was first used by anatomist Giovanni Battista Montanus Tedeschi in his book De ossibus mandibulae et dentium natura published in Venice in 1548. The term ""boat shaped"" refers to the fact that this bone resembles a small boat with two ends and a curved side. The distal end of the scaphoideum articulates with the lunate bone, while the proximale end articulates directly with the radius bone. The base of the trapezium bone sits on top of the head of the second metacarpal bone, which rests upon the tub"

Note : In Urea Cycle Disorders Ammonia level increases so we use drugs which will help in reducing the ammonia levels by increasing its excretion through urine.

Ammonium ion can be converted into free ammoniacal ions by liver cells. These free ammonical ions then diffuse across basolateral membrane of renal tubular epithelial cell where it enters into circulation & finally gets filtered at glomerulus. Here this ammoniacals get reabsorbed back into peritubular capillaries. This process continues until there is enough amount of sodium present in lumen of proximal convoluted tubule. Once sufficient sodium is available, Na+ K ATPase pump present on apical border of these cells helps in active transpo of NH3 out of the cell.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. The risk of developing ITP after measles vaccination has been repoed to be higher than that seen in unvaccinated children exposed naturally to wild-type measles virus. This may reflect an increased sensitivity among young infants who have recently received their first dose of measles-containing vaccine. Infants should receive vitamin A supplementation at ages 6,9,12,15,18,24 months; if they present late with measles, it should be administered immediately. If there is no history of previous immunization against tetanus, diphtheria toxoids containing tetanus-diphthera toxoids should be given along with measles vaccine. Children under age 1 year receiving live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3) can develop febrile seizures within 48 hours of LAIV administration. These events were more common when LAIV was used alone compared with concomitant use of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. However, these adverse effects do not preclude future receipt of LA IV. Live viral vaccines such as mumps-measles-rubella (MMR), varicella-zoster, zoster, yellow fever, rotavirus, oral polio, and intranasal influenza vaccine must be delayed until 2 weeks post-chemotherapy completion.

### Response:
 g B i.e., Sacket David L.Sackett is considered to be ""Father of Evidence Based Medicine""Q (EBM). He defined EBM in his book ""Clinical Epidemiology - Basic Science & Clinical Practice"". According to him, it means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external evidence from systematic research. It requires that decisions regarding patient care should be based on current scientific knowledge and the application of this knowledge into practice. In order to do so he has developed an approach called ""Evidence-Based Medicine"", which includes four steps: Formulating answerable questions; Searching for studies relevant to the question; Appraising the validity and relevance of retrieved studies; Applying results to patients. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), meta-analysis and Cochrane reviews have been found most useful in answering PICO (Patient-Intervention-Comparison-Outcomes) type of questions. RCTs are regarded as the gold standard of medical evidence because they minimize bias and confounding variables. However, there may be situations where randomization cannot be used such as when treatment must be offered urgently or when ethical considerations make it impossible to withhold effective therapy. Such non-randomised designs include before-and-after comparisons, historical controls, case-control studies and cohort studies. These study types can also"

### Response:
 g Option C : Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) reduce total cholesterol levels by reducing VLDL production in liver. They also increase hepatic uptake of LDL receptors resulting in increased clearance of circulating LDL paicles. The most impoant effect of statin therapy is reduction in cardiovascular events rather than just lowering serum lipids. However, they have no significant effect on triglyceride level. Fibrates act primarily to decrease plasma triglycerides but can raise HDL-C levels. Combination of statins with fibrates would be more effective in managing dyslipidemia. But since statins do not affect triglyceridemia significantly, it will be better if we use them separately. In this case, since the patient has high LDL levels, staing rosuvastain alone should suffice. Ref: Harrisons Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th Edition, Page 3100; Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment Chapter 25 ; Lipid Disorders By Michael H. Davidson, MD, Pages 101-102

### Response:
 g. The chi-squared test is used when comparing two groups with categorical data. It can also be used if there are more than two categories within one variable. For example, you might want to know whether people who have had a heart attack differ from those without such an event on their smoking status. In this case, your sample would consist of both cases (people who have experienced a hea attack) and controls (those who haven't), but it wouldn't make sense to calculate means because they don't represent continuous variables; instead, you'd count how many smokers were among the cases and how many among the controls. If these numbers differed significantly between the two groups, that could indicate that having a heabeat may depend upon being a smoker. This type of study is called a case-control study. Another use of the chi- squared test is to determine whether observed frequencies follow expected ones. You might ask yourself what percentage of men and women smoke cigarettes. To answer this question, you need to look at the total number of smokers and non-smokers in your population, then divide them into males and females. By calculating percentages for each gender separately, you'll get some idea of which sex smokes most often. But before doing so, you must first check whether"

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 gH+ = (10 -pH)
= (1000 - 60)
= 40 meq/litre
Base excess is calculated by using formula :
BE = gH+ + CO2 content – HCO-
Here,
gH+= 40meq/ litre
CO2 content = 1mmol /L per mmHg
So, CO2content here will be 30mEq/L
Hence, the correct answer is A (300 m Eq). (+/- sign doesnot matter).
Excess acid can also be measured directly by calculating the difference between plasma bicarbonate concentration and normal value minus the change in PCO2 divided by 20. This calculation yields an estimate of the amount of acid that must have been added to produce the observed metabolic acidosis. The result is expressed as milliequivalents of base deficit or negative base excess. For example, if the serum bicarbonate level is 12 mg/dl when it should be 24 mg/di, but there has been no change in PaCO2, then 12mg/dl x 1 meg/liter/meg/dl equals 12 meg/liters of unmeasured acid. If the PaCO 2 was decreased by"

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
  B. RBC - 30°C, FPP 2–6°c, Platelets 20–22 °c

Explanation: Red cells should be stored at +1 to +8 degrees Celsius in blood bank refrigerator. The storage time is up to 35 days after addition of Adenine, Citrate Phosphate Dextrose (CPD), or Citrate phosphate dextrose adenine (CPDA). 
Platelets must be kept between 20 and 24 degree centigrade during transportation and storage. They can be used within five days if they have been irradiated before use. If no radiation has taken place then their shelf life will be three days maximum. 
Fresh frozen plasma contains all coagulation factors except factor VIII. It is usually prepared by adding anticoagulants like citric acid-citrate-dextrose or citric-acid-phosphate-dextroglucose solution. This prevents clotting until it reaches body temperature when fibrinogen level falls below 100 mg/dl. It should be maintained at –18 ±5 degree centigree throughout its entire period of storage which is six months. Before transfusion, thawing takes place either manually with shaking or mechanically using water bath at 30"

D) Total thyroidectomy
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. Management of PTC includes total thyroidectomy (not lobectomy), central compartment lymphadenopathy should be addressed by level VI nodal dissection if clinically palpable nodes present; ipsilateral lateral neck dissection may also be required depending upon preoperative imaging studies and intra-operative findings. RAI therapy can be used to destroy residual disease after surgery but it has no role during pregnancy due to risk of fetal hypothyroidism and potential teratogenic effects of radiation exposure. The patient's age does not influence treatment recommendations.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Radioactive iodINE ablation). (Ref: Schwaz 9/e p1380)
The most common type of thyroid cancer is Papillary Carcinoma which accounts for approximately 85% of all cases. It usually presents as painless cervical adenopathy that is discovered incidentally. Treatment consists of total thyroidctomy followed by radioactive Iodine remnant ablation and lifelong thyroxin replacement. If there is evidence of metastatic disease then external beam radiotherapy must be considered. Lymph node involvement is an impoant prognostic factor.

### Response:
 g. Rashes of dengue fever may be macular (flat), maculopopular (small spots), or petechial (tiny red dots). The most common type of rash associated with rubella infection is flat to slightly raised pink patches on the skin that can appear anywhere on the body but often occur inside the mouth, throat, palms, soles, wrists, web spaces between fingers, and neck. Measles causes an itchy, blotchy, reddish-brown rash which usually appears two days after the onset of symptoms. It stas behind the ears and spreads down the sides of the head towards the front of the face. A few hours later, more areas will become affected until eventually almost every inch of skin has been covered by the rash. Shingles occurs when varicella-zoster virus reactivates years after initial chickenpox illness. Rash typically begins as small blisters around one area of the body before spreading over several days into a band-like pattern across the chest or abdomen, sometimes affecting multiple dermatomes.
Hence, the correct answer is D (Zoster). (Ref : Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 18th edition pg no. 1385)

### Response:
 g Mesio-lingual grooves occur on maxillary central & lateral incisors (rarely).
Hence, the correct answer is C (Maxillary lateralincisor). (Ref: Textbook of endodontics by K S NARAYANAN page no 8)
 
The mesial surface of most teeth has one or more grooves that may be continuous with the distal surface. The location of these grooves varies depending upon tooth type.

In mandibular anterior teeth, they run obliquely across the mesiodistal long axis of the crown; this is called an oblique groove. In posterior teeth, it runs parallel to the occlusoapical length of the root; this can also be referred to as an oblong groove. These grooves usually do not extend onto the proximal surfaces of adjacent teeth but sometimes will continue into the interproximal area between two roots. They often contain calcified structures such as pulp stones or cementum tags within them.
On some teeth there are additional grooves located along the mesiopalatal or linguppalatal aspect of the mesial root. This is known as a transverse groove because its orientation crosses the longitudinal axis of both the crown and root. Transverse"

Hence, the correct answer is D (Conditions effecting i.e., Infections). (Ref: Nelson's Textbook of Pediatrics 20th edition Page no- 86)
Hence most common cause for post-neonatal death is infection which occurs after first week of life.
Post Neonatal Period

The postneonatal period extends from birth to one year of age.

It accounts for approximately 30% of all infant deaths.
Most frequent underlying conditions include congenital anomalies, prematurity, low bih weight, respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage, hypothermia, and apnea.
Infection remains an important factor throughout this time frame.
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), also known as ""crib death,"" is the leading cause of death between 1 month and 1 yr of age.
Other significant factors contributing to SIDS include maternal smoking, sleeping on stomachs, soft bedding, overheating, and sleeping with others.
Risk factors associated with increased incidence of sudden infant death syndrome include male sex; premature delivery (<37 weeks' gestation); history of apnea/bradycardia/respiratory arrest; family history of stillbirth, miscarriage"

Follow up after conservative surgery

The routine follow-up consists of regular physical examination and periodic imaging studies to detect recurrence at its earliest stage when it may be more amenable to curative treatment.

Invasive carcinoma

After BCS, patients should have their breasts examined clinically every 3-4 months in the first two years and then less frequently thereafter. Mammographic screening should begin within six weeks of completing primary therapy and continue yearly thereafter. The role of MRI scanning remains controversial but can be considered if there is high risk of local recurrence or where mammograms are technically difficult because of dense breast tissue.

Radiotherapy-induced fibrosis makes assessment of the treated area unreliable; therefore, ultrasound has no place in surveillance after radiotherapy.

Hence, the correct answer is A (Hemi desмосome). (Ref: Textbook of Microbiology & Immunology, Parija - pg no- 230)
Vibrios adhere to mucosal epithelial cells through hemi-desmosomal proteins such as E-cadherin and plakoglobin. The adherence causes disruption in tight junctions leading to loss of water and electrolytes into lumen resulting in watery diarrhea.
Hence it is important that you know what are Hemidesmosome and Tight Junctions.

Tight junctions

Also known as Occluding junctions or zonula occludents
They are present between two adjacent epithelial cell membranes

 gHence coicosteroids should be avoided in all these conditions except e coli sepsis where it can reduce moality by half.Ref: Harrison's Internal Medicine; 18th edition
Hence, the correct answer is A (E.coli septicaemia). (Ref: Harrison’s Internal Medicine ; 18 th ed)
The use of corticosteriods in severe infections has been controversial because they may suppress host defenses against infection. However, there have been several studies that suggest benefit to patients with gram-negative bacteremic shock treated with intravenous hydrocoisone. The most recent study demonstrated an absolute reduction in moality rate of approximately 50% among those receiving steroids compared with placebo. This effect was seen regardless of whether the patient had evidence of adrenal insufficiency at baseline. These data support the use of intravenous steroids in selected cases of refractory septic shock due to gram-negative organisms.
Intravenous hydrocortisone appears to improve survival rates in some critically ill patients who do not respond adequately to fluid resuscitation alone.

### Response:
 g/milliliter
Hence, the correct answer is C (Urinary concentration...). (Ref: Ganong's physiology 23rd edn / 678)
Hence the correct Answer is C ((Urinary...). (Ganong's Physiology 23/e p677-679; Guyton & Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology 12th edition pg no: 846).
Note - The normal value of urine osmolality ranges between 500 to 1200 mOsm/kg H2O. Osmolal clearances can be calculated by multiplying urinary osmolal excretion with urine flow rate divided by plasma osmolatility. Normal values range from 50% to 70%. A low fractional excretion indicates that kidney tubules reabsorb solute along with water resulting in concentrated urine whereas high fraction suggests that kidneys secrete solutes into tubular fluid which dilutes it. This occurs when there is an excess of sodium chloride in blood such as seen in hyperglycemia due to diabetes mellitus type I. It also happens during treatment with diuretics like furosemide.

The most common arrythmia associated with typhus fevers is sinus tachycardiabegins to slow down during second week of illness; relative bradvcardia occurs when temperature exceeds 40degc. Fever due to factitious disease usually has an irregular pattern but can be regular at times. It is difficult to distinguish between true pyrogenic infection and factitiusly induced fever by clinical criteria alone. However, if there is no evidence of acute bacterial infection, viral hepatitis, endocarditis, urinary tract infections etc. then it should raise suspicion of factitous fever. A high white blood cell count does not rule out this diagnosis because many patients will have leukocytosis secondary to stress. Leukopenia also cannot exclude this possibility.

Explanation: Collum angle of mandible is measured by taking perpendicular to occlusal plane at distobuccal cusp of lower first molar. It should be between 90-120 degree. In class II division 1 it will increase more than 130 degrees.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Class II div 1). (Ref : Textbook of orthodontics Gurkeerat Singh 3rd ed P: 30)
 
Collum Angle

The normal range of measurement is between 100°and 110°.

In skeletal class II cases, this value increases due to retrognathic mandibular growth pattern.
This can also occur when there is an excessive proclination of upper incisors which results in increased overjet.
It decreases with prognathism of mandibles.

### Response:
 g C (Mean circulatory filing pressure). (Ref: Ganong, Review of Medical Physiology, 22nd edition, page no-544)MEAN CIRCULATORY FILLING PRESSUREIt is defined as the average pressure that would be recorded by an intravascular catheter placed anywhere within the circulation when all the vessels were suddenly stopped from flowing.It can also be calculated mathematically using the formulaPc = Pao + Prv/2Where Pc - mean circulatory fillng pressure.Pao - aerial diastolic pressurePrv - venous pressureCritical Closing PressureThe critical closing pressure is the minimum pressure at which small arteries will close off.The value varies between species but averages around 30 mmHg in humans.Critical closing pressure occurs because of viscoelasticity of vessel walls; it does not occur with rigid tubes.Perfusion PressurePerfusion pressure refers to the difference between arterial and venous pressures.In skeletal muscle this perfusion pressure ranges from approximately 50 to 70 mm Hg during rest.Pulse PressurePulse pressure is equal to systolic minus diastole blood pressure.

Ureteral injuries occur in approximately 1% to 2% of all gynecologic operations; however, they may be more common with radical surgery such as that performed during staging procedures for cervical cancer. The incidence of uretero-vaginal fistulae has been repoed at 0.5%-6%. Most commonly these injuries result from ligation of the distal ureters either within the bladder wall or near its mucosal surface. Other causes include transection of the ureter secondary to misidentification of the structure on surgical dissection, direct trauma to the ureters due to retraction or placement of sutures into the urethra or vagina, and ischemia resulting from occlusion of blood supply to the pelvis. Ureters can also become kinked between ligatures placed around the uterine vessels. Injuries to the upper third of the uterus have an increased likelihood of causing damage to the renal pedicle.

### Response:
 ganser syndrome is an organic brain disease that can be caused by many different factors including head trauma, encephalitis, Alzheimer's disease, Korsakoff Syndrome, Wernicke-Korsakoffs Syndrome, alcohol abuse, drug use (such as amphetamines), hypoglycemia, vitamin deficiencies, carbon monoxide poisoning, and even cancer. It has also been known to occur after ceain types of surgery such as craniotomy. The symptoms include confabulation, which means making up information without realizing it is false; memory loss; poor judgment; lack of insight into one's own illness; and apathy. In some cases, patients may have hallucinations, delusions, depression, anxiety, agitation, aggression, and/or seizures. There are four main features of Ganser's syndrome: approximate answers, clouding of consciousness, visual hallucinations and pseudodementia. Approximate answers are when someone gives answers that seem close but not exact. For example if asked how old they were, they might say ""around"" instead of giving their actual age. Clouded consciousness refers to confusion and disorientation. Visual hallucinations refer to seeing things that aren't there. Pseudodementia occurs when people act like they have dementia"

### Response:
 g] Ans. is d i.e. Tetanus Toxoid Prevention of tetanus : - Primary prevention (Prevention of first attack) : It can be achieved by active immunization with adsorbed tetanus toxiod vaccine. Booster doses should be given every 5-10 years to maintain immunity. Secondary prevention (prevention of recurrence): This includes both passive & active immunisation. Passive prophylaxis consists of administration of human tetanus immune globulin (TIG). Active immunization is same as in primary prevention. So, the answer here would have been either d or e but since no option has been provided we will go ahead with d which is more appropriate because it prevents infection itself whereas TIG just neutralizes toxin already formed. ""Active immunization remains the mainstay of secondary prevention"" -- Park 20/e p 258 Remember : In case of wound where there is high risk of tetanis, if patient is unknown about his vaccination status then he must receive Td booster alongwith TIG.

 g C i.e., (XII, XI,IX,X)
Hence, the correct answer is C (X II, XI I, IX,X). (Ref: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease South Asia Edition - Page No; 99-100).
Coagulation cascade can be divided into three major pathways : Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Common Coagulation Cascade.
Intrinsic pathway initiates with factor XII activation by contact between blood cells and negatively charged surfaces such as glass or collagen fibers. This leads to sequential activation of factors XI, IX, VIII, X and prothrombin (factor II), resulting in thrombin formation.
Extrinsic pathway begins when tissue factor binds to activated factor VIIa. The complex then activates factor III, which in turn activates factor X. Factor X is also activated directly by the intrinsic pathway. Once both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways converge on factor X, they form a common pathway that ultimately results in conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin.

 ganser syndrome (also known as pseudodementia, hysterical dementia, or folie à double) is an iatrogenic disorder that can be induced in patients who have been subjected to prolonged periods of isolation, usually within psychiatric facilities. It has also been described in prisoners of war and hostages. The symptoms include confusion, disorientation, amnesia, hallucinations, delusions, and catatonia. These symptoms mimic those found in organic brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Korsakoff's syndrome, Wernicke-Korsakoffs syndrome, and delirium tremens. Ganser's syndrome was first identified by Sigbert Gansser in 1898. In some cases it may occur spontaneously; however, most often it occurs secondary to another condition, paicularly malingering. Malingering refers to feigning illness for specific gain, which could be financial compensation, avoiding work, military duty, etc. Ref Harrison20th edition pgno: 1207

### Response:
 glasses with two distinct optical powers (e.g., distance vision on top and near-vision at bottom). They can be prescribed to patients who have difficulty seeing both far away and close up without corrective lenses; they may also be worn by people whose refractive error changes significantly between day and night, such as those with myopic astigmatism. In children, bifocal glasses are sometimes prescribed when there is significant anisometropia, which causes eye strain that cannot be corrected with contact lenses. However, this is rare because most children do not need more than -3 D of spherical correction. Refractive errors greater than -6 D require monofocal glasses rather than bifocal lenses. Monovision refers to wearing one contact lens for distant tasks and another for near tasks. This technique allows some individuals to adapt to having different prescriptions in their eyes while still being able to judge depth well enough to perform daily activities safely. It has been shown to improve visual performance in many cases but does not work equally well for everyone. Some studies show no difference in binocular function after switching to monovision compared with keeping both eyes fully corrected.

### Response:
 g D i.e., Numbesss Complications of Stroke that require treatment include fever (hyperthermia), spasticity, dysphasia & dysphagiasQ. The most common cause of death in patients with acute ischemic strokes is pneumonia secondary to aspiration due to pharyngeal dysfunction caused by brainstem infarction. This can occur within hours after onset of symptoms. Therefore, it is impoant to assess swallowing function early on in these patients. If there is evidence of abnormal swallowing mechanism, then nasogastric tube should be placed until fuher evaluation has been completed. In addition, if patient develops signs of aspiration such as coughing during feeding, he/she should have immediate endoscopic examination of esophagus and stomach followed by placement of percutaneous gastrostomy tube. Aspiration occurs more commonly when the lesion involves the pons than the medulla because of loss of protective reflexes in the former location. Patients who develop aphasic syndromes may also benefit from speech therapy. Aphasia rehabilitation programs focus on improving language comprehension and production skills. These programs use techniques designed to improve attention span, memory, word retrieval, auditory processing, reading, writing, and visual perception.

A) Are penicillinase resistant
B) Produce acid during metabolism
C) Produce extracellular polysachharides
D) Ferment carbohydrates
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Streptococcus mutans is an important species in dental plaque because of its role in causing dental caries. It adheres firmly to smooth enamel surface by means of adhesins (glucan-binding proteins).
Hence, the correct answer is C (Produce extracellular polisachharide). (Ref: Ananthnarayan 8th/ed p-204)
The virulence factors that help streptococcii cause disease include:

Adhesion - The first step in pathogenesis is adherence to host cells. Adherence can be mediated through fimbriae, fibrillae, slime layer, hemagglutinin, lectin-like molecules, cell wall components such as peptidoglycan, teichoic acids, lipoteichoic acid, protein A, fibronectin binding proteins etc.

Production of exotoxins - Some strains produce superantigens which stimulate T lymphocytes leading to massive release of cytokines resulting in toxic shock syndrome.
Production of enzymes - They may also produce hyaluronidases, DNAse, RNAse, proteolytic enzyme, phospholipase, catalase, urease etc.
Antibiotic resistance - Penicillin-resistant S.pneumonia"

D) Triglycerides
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g C i.e., Long Chain Fatty Acid Zellwenger Syndrome (cerebrohepatorenal syndrome; Proliferative Infantile Leukodystrophy) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by absence of peroxisomesQ resulting in deficiency of enzymes that require these organelles such as catalase & uric acid oxidase. This results in accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA), which accumulate in tissues including CNS causing severe neurologic abnormalities like hypotonicity, facial grimace, hepatomegaly, renal cysts, retinal degeneration etc. Diagnosis can be made by demonstration of elevated levels of VLCFAs in plasma/serumQ. Treatment consists of dietary restriction of phytanic acid containing foods (fish oil, dairy products). Liver transplantation has been tried but without success.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Long chain fattyacid). (Option b is also related to this condition due to mitochondrial dysfunction.).. (Ref: Nelson's 18th/chapter 599)

### Response:
 g Pulpectomy is indicated in case of pulpally involved tooth that has no chance of healing by root canal treatment (e.g., due to extensive caries). It can be done on all deciduous teeth except those with open apexes because they have potential for continued growth. The indications include:

Pulpal exposure during cavity preparation
Traumatic exposures
Root fracture involving crown portion
Recurrent infection after endodontic therapy

The procedure involves removal of infected tissue within the chamber and roots followed by irrigation and obturation using zinc oxide eugenol paste.

D) Rectum
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. The ovary has been shown to be one of the most radio sensitive structures within the body. It can tolerate doses less than 20 Gy before significant damage occurs. This makes it an organ at risk when treating cancers that involve this area such as cervical cancer, uterine sarcoma, vaginal cancer, rectal cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and lymphoma. Radiation injury to the ovaries may result in ovarian failure leading to amenorrhea and infertility. In women who have completed their family, radiation therapy may induce menopause. Women receiving chemotherapy also experience premature menopause due to alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide). These patients should receive hormone replacement therapy after completion of treatment. Patients who wish to preserve fertility must avoid both surgery and radiation to the abdomen/pelvis. Chemotherapy does not affect future reproductive potential unless high-dose regimens are used. High dose cyclophophamide (>6 g/m2), cisplatin (>100 mg/m2 ), procarbazine (>2000 mg/m3 ) and carboplatin (>800 mg/mq) all carry a small but definite risk of causing permanent sterility.

### Response:
 gates biostatistics 11th edition page no- 771 table 33.1, ref : p<0.05 is considered significant. here we have two groups so student t-test will be used.
Hence, the correct answer is A (Student's t Test). (Ref: Park 23rd/ed/pg 845; style=""font-size: 1.04761904761905em; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif"">)
The most commonly used tests to determine whether there is statistically significant differences between means of more than two independent samples are analysis of variance (ANOVA).
In this case since it’s just one sample before and after intervention paired ‘t’ test should be done.
If you want to compare mean height of different group then anova should be applied.
For example if you want see which gender has higher average height then you need to do unpaired t test.
So according to above explanation:

if comparing same data set before & after intervention → Paired T test
if comparing different data sets e.g., male vs female → Unpaired T test

Note - If number of variables >2 then Anova should b used instead of T test.

Explanation: Vascular malformations

Vascular lesions may be divided into two groups : -

1.	True vascular malformation → These include capillary malformation, venous malformation & lymphatic malformation.

2.	Pseudo-vascular malformation (tumors) → Hemangiomas


The key point which differentiates between true vascular malformances and pseudo-vascular malformance (hemangiomas) is their natural history.


True vascular anomalies do not regress spontaneously whereas hemangiomas undergo involution.


So, if a patient presents at birth with a cutaneous vascular anomaly, it is either a congenital vascular malformaton or an infantile hemangiona. But, these two have distinctly different clinical features :-


Congenital vascular Malformations

### Response:
 g. i.e. (Insulin) (410- Ganong 22nd)* The onset of puberty is triggered by an increase in secretion of gonadotropins which stimulates growth of the ovaries or testes* In girls this leads to increased estrogen production that causes breast budding and widening of hips.* Estrogen also increases fat deposition around breasts and buttocks and promotes development of female secondary sexual characteristics such as menstruation, wider pelvis, more rounded shoulders, less muscle mass, softer skin, hairier legs and arms, and changes in body contours**In boys it results in enlargement of scrotum and penis due to testosterone action on these organs*** Pubic hair begins to grow at the time of peak LH pulse frequency during sleep. This may be related to high levels of insulin-like growth factor -1 secreted by adipose tissue during sleep* Growth spurt occurs after menarche and peaks just before completion of height gain. It is caused by increased secretion of growth hormone and IGF-I induced by sex steroids* **Leptin acts through hypothalamus to regulate pituitary function and thus controls reproductive functions.

Explanation:

S-ECC

Severe early childhood caries 

It refers to presence of one or more decayed (non-cavitated lesions) or cavitated lesions that have progressed to the dentin requiring restorative treatment of at least one primary tooth in a child younger than six years old.
The term severe ECC indicates an increased risk of progression of disease and potential need for extensive dental intervention.
Children who develop severe ECC often require multiple visits to receive necessary care.
In addition, children with severe ECC frequently experience significant anxiety related to their dental visit experiences because they must undergo repeated treatments over several months.
This fear can result in avoidance behaviors such as refusing future dental appointments.
Therefore, it is essential to identify these patients early so that preventive measures can be taken before the condition progresses further.

 gives information regarding number of completed pregnancies (gravida), number of live bihs (para), and number of spontaneous abortions (miscarriages). The numbers in parentheses refer to previous stillbihs. In this case, the patient's history indicates that she has been pregnant five times; however, one fetus died before term and another after term but before delivery. Therefore, she should be classified as having delivered two children alive and three dead fetuses. Her current pregnancy would therefore be considered her fifth pregnancy (G5).

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 gates Physiologically, axons can be divided into three types based on their conduction velocities (CV). Type A fibers have CVs greater than 12 m/s; type B fibers range between 5-12 m / s; and C-fibers conduct at less than 2m/s. The largest-diameter fibers tend to be myelinated and therefore transmit signals more rapidly than smaller ones. In general, there is an inverse relationship between fiber size and frequency of firing. Smaller fibers fire in bursts with high frequencies, whereas larger fibers discharge infrequently but maintain activity over long periods of time. This may explain why pain sensation has such rapid onset and termination compared to touch and pressure sensations that require sustained activation of sensory receptors.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology;24th edition; page no:-162
Hence, the correct answer is A (Conduction velocity). (Ref: Ganongs review of Medical Physiology 24/e p163)The rate of propagation of action potential along a neuron depends upon its length, diameter & degree of myelinization.The longer the fibre,the slower it conducts impulses.Myelination increases the speed of impulse transmission by allowing current flow through nodes of Ranvier instead of flowing continuously down entire"

 g. Southampton scoreWound assessment tools include the Wound Bed Score (WBS), which includes tissue type, exudate amount, bacterial load, and edge quality; the Grading System by Fenton et al., which uses redness, edema, pain on movement, breakdown, and discharge to grade wounds into four categories; and the Southampton grading tool, which assesses wound size, depth, location, and presence of necrotic tissue, slough, granulation, epithelialization, and exudates. The most commonly used classification systems in clinical practice are those developed by Lundholm and Larsson and Winter. These two scales use different criteria but both have five grades that describe increasing severity of wound healing impairment. In addition, there are several specific scores designed to evaluate burn injuries such as the Paediatric Burn Wound Assessment Tool (PBWAT). This scale evaluates six parameters including erythema, induration, blistering, eschar formation, adherence, and re-epithelialisation. It has been shown to be reliable when compared with the Lund-Browder diagram. Ref - Bailey and love surgery 27e p7, Wikipedia

### Response:
 g. (Ref KDT 6/e p816; Katzung 10th/ e p1078)Minocyclin is an antibiotic which can cause blue black discolouration of teeth in children.Minocyclines also produces hyperpigmentations resembling those seen with Addison's disease but more diffuse and irregular than that caused by ACTH deficiency.The pattern may be reticulate, macular, blotchy, mottled, or streaked, often involving sun-exposed areas such as the face, neck, hands, forearms, and anterior chest. The lesions usually fade over time after discontinuation of therapy.Bleomycins are antitumor antibiotics used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma, testicular cancer, and certain types of head & Neck cancers.Vincristin is a vinca alkaloid used in chemotherapy.Daunorubucin is anthracycline derivative used in treatment of acute leukemia.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Minoccycline). (Ref: Goodman Gillman 12/e pg 1729-30)Flagellated Pigmentation - Seen with minocyclene, it appears like Addisonian Hyperpigmentation but is more diffuse, irregular and involves exposed area like forehead, neck etc."

### Response:
 g Mesio-buccal grooves are present on maxillary first molar & second molar teeth; mesiolingual grooves occur on maxilliary central incisors, maxillary lateral ineisors, mandibular canines, mandiublar premolars (except lower left), upper molars except third molars.

Ref : Textbook of endodontics Nisha Garg pg-8
Hence, the correct answer is C (Maxillary lateralincisor). In case of doubt go for maxillary laterals because they have both mesial marginal and disto-mesial marginal grooves.
Hence it is option c that is correct.
Mandibular Lateral Incisor has Distolingual Groove.
Mandiublar First Premolar has Distobuccal Marginal Ridge.
Maxillary Second Molar has Mesio buccal Margina Ridge.
HENCE THE ANSWER IS MAXILLARY LATERAL INCISOR.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Bevelling is done to reduce the sharpness of internal line angles on proximal surfaces of teeth so that they do not act as stress concentrators. It also helps to prevent food lodgement at these sites.

Counter bevelling is used when there is an excessive reduction of enamel on one side of the contact area. This can occur if the gingival margin has been cut too high during preparation of occluso-gingival margins. The counterbevel will help to restore the natural contour of the interproximal surface by creating a slight convexity opposite to the original site of removal.
It is contraindicated with lingually placed restorations because it may weaken the remaining enamel wall of the cavity preparation.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Lingual surface of premolar). (Ref: Sturdevant's art and science of operative dentistry, 3rd ed page no- 168)

### Response:
 g. Infeility due to Asherman's syndrome (i.e., uterine adhesions) can present in women who have had multiple dilatation and curettage procedures after an abortion or delivery. The diagnosis may be made by hysteroscopy. Treatment consists of resection of the adhesiolysis followed by placement of intrauterine devices that release progesterone. This will help prevent further scarring and promote endometrial growth. If there has been no previous surgery on the uterus, it should be evaluated using sonohysterography or saline infusion hystero- graphy. These techniques allow visualization of the cavity without performing invasive surgery. Sonohysterogram involves placing fluid into the uterus through the cervix while doing ultrasound imaging. Saline infusion hysterscopy uses similar technique but allows direct inspection of the inside of the uterus. Both methods are useful for identifying fibroids, polyps, septa, and adhesins within the uterus.
Hence, the correct answer is D (Uterine synchae). (Ref: William's Obstetrics 23rd edition Page 1085)

The Temporomandible Joint

It is an unusual synovial joint between the head of the mandible and articular tubercle of temporal bone.

Development:

Mandibulae Fossae - It appears in human embryo during sixth week of intrauterine life. Mandibula fossa is situated on either side of midline just below the base of skull. During seventh week it fuses to form one piece which will develop into mandible. At this time mandibulofacial dysostosis occurs if there is failure of fusion resulting in cleft lip and palate. Fusion of two halves of mandible takes place by eighth week. By ninth week mandible has developed completely except condyle and ramus which appear later. Articular disc also begins its formation by end of third month. Condylar process grows rapidly after birth and reaches adult size by puberty."

Hence, the correct answer is B (Serum ferritin). (Ref: Williams Obstetrics 23rd edition pg 795)
Iron Deficiency Anemia

The diagnosis of anemia can be made by measuring hemoglobin concentration.

In pregnant women with normal hematocrit values at term, serum ferritin levels <15 mg/L indicate that there has been significant iron deficiency during gestation.

Ferritin reflects both total body stores & current activity of inflammation; it also correlates well with bone marrow stainable iron content.
Normal value = 20-200 ng/mL
Decreased level indicates Iron deficiency anemia
Increased level indicates Inflammation
Transferrin saturation measures percentage of TIBC bound to iron.
Normal range = 30% -50%
Low levels may occur due to:

Chronic disease
Malnutrition
Alcoholism
High altitude
Pregnancy
Zinc deficiency
Vitamin C deficiency

Question: Portion of tooth covered by calculus or altered cementum is:
Options:
A) Toxic zone
B) Deposit zone
C) Instrumentation zone
D) Take away zone
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Toxic Zone (portion of root surface that has been in contact with plaque and calculus)
h Deposit Zone (area where new deposits will form after instrumentation)
i Instrumentation Zone (portions of root surfaces exposed to oral environment during debridement)
j Take Away Zone (Portion of root covered by Calculus or Altered Cementum)

Ref: Sturdevant operative dentistry 7th edition Page no 318
Hence, the correct answer is D (Take away zone). (+) (-) A B C. Explanation: The area on the root surface which was previously covered by plaque and/or calculus is called take-away zone. This portion of the root does not need additional treatment because it cannot be colonized again by bacteria. It also contains less collagen than deposit zone and therefore requires minimal etching time.
Hence the correct Answer is D i.e. Take away Zone Ref: Sturdvant Operative Dentistry 8/e p320

D) ESV first decrease and then increases
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g A (ESV decreases) Ref: Guyton & Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology, 12th editionExplanation:""The stroke volume rises during heavy exercise because both the end-diastolic volume and the contractility rise."" -Guytons End diastole volume = Stroke Volume + End Systolic VolumeStroke volume remains constant at rest but it increases with increasing intensity of exercise.End-systolic volume will be less when compared to resting state due to increased contractility.Increased contractility results in decreased end- systolic volumes which leads to an overall increase in stroke volume.The cardiac output can also be calculated by multiplying heart rate and stroke volume.Cardiac Output= Heart Rate x Stroke VolumeCardiac output increases linearly with the severity of exercise up to maximum level that individual can tolerate.
Hence, the correct answer is A (EVS decreases). (Ref: Guytoms 13/e p 108; Ganong's Review of medical physiology 23rd ed pg no 532)

Question: Which of these amino acids does not enter the Krebs cycle by forming Acetyl-CoA pyruvate?
Options:

D) Alanine
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Amino acid that do not form acetyl CoA in mitochondria (i.e., those which cannot be oxidized to CO2 ) can undergo transamination reactions with oxaloacetate to yield new amino acids such as alanine and aspaic acid. These two amino acids may then be transported into liver cells where they serve as substrates for gluconeogenesis. The carbon skeletons of glycine, serine, cysteine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, histidine, arginine, lysine, methionine, isoleucine, valine, leucine and proline all give rise to intermediates of the citric acid cycle. However, some of them first have to be conveed to other compounds before entering the cycle. For example, hydroxypyruvatederived from glycolysis is reduced to D-glycerate by NADH-dependent glycerate dehydrogenase; this reaction occurs in peroxisomes. In animals, but not plants, the enzyme is specific for L-hydroxpyruvare derived from serine. This reaction is impoant because it allows the conversion of glucose to succinylCoA"

The most common cause of hemolytic anemia after red-cell transfusions is alloimmunization against human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched antigens on donor white blood cells that cross-react with similar epitopes on red cells. This reaction occurs more frequently when patients receive multiple units of packed red cells during massive transfusions or exchange procedures.

### Response:
 gih Etch times of 20 to 40 seconds have been recommended by many authors; however, some studies suggest that longer etchant application may result in better bond strength due to increased surface area available for bonding.

Ref: Phillips Ed 12th P: 403
Hence, the correct answer is B (15-30 sec). (but keep in mind that it can vary between different sources)
If you want more information on this topic then read below:

The enamel surfaces prepared using phosphoric acid were examined under scanning electron microscopy before and after drying. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the mean values of the surface areas obtained immediately after etching and those measured at 1 min intervals up to 5 min post-etching. This suggests that the surface area created during acid conditioning does not change significantly over a period of several minutes. It has also been shown previously that the microleakage of composite restorations bonded to such conditioned enamel surfaces did not increase when the etching time was extended beyond 2–3 min. These findings indicate that an etching duration of approximately 2 min would appear sufficient to create adequate microporous structure for bonding purposes.

D) Zinc phosphate
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 gic has highest elastic modulus among all cements.

Ref: Phillips Ed 12th P: 373
Hence, the correct answer is B (GIC). (but keep in mind that this is an indirect repeat from Nov 2011)
For direct support to tooth structure, zinc phosphate is preferred because it bonds well with dentin.
Zinc eugenol cements have low strength and high solubility; they also release formaldehyde when set.
Polycarbboxylates bond poorly to enamel but adhere well to both enamel and metal substrates.
Glass ionomer cements exhibit good biocompatibility and bonding properties, but their mechanical properties are inferior to those of resin-modified glass-ionomers and composite resins.
Resin-modified materials combine many desirable features of conventional composites with some characteristics similar to those found in glass-ionomer cem­ents.
Key Concept: 
Elastic Modulus

The ability of a material to resist deformation under load without rupture is known as its tensile strength. The resistance of a dental restorative material to compression is called compressive strength. Elasticity refers to the capacity of a solid substance to return to its original shape after removal of stress applied to deform it. A measure of a specimen’s"

### Response:
 g. Vision 20201 is an initiative by WHO to eliminate avoidable causes of visual impairment in the world by year 20202. It was launched at Aravind Eye Hospital3 in Madurai on 16th February1999. The main aim of this programme is to reduce global backlog of uncorrected refractive error (REFRACTIVE ERROR IS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF BLINDNESS IN INDIA). This can be achieved through increasing number of eye care centres across India. As per estimates there should be one centre for every 100000 people. Currently we have around 1500 such centres which means that we need another 14000 more centres. So total no. of required centres will be 15000 + 150 = 16500. But among these 15,000 already existing centres some do not function properly so they also require upgradation. Therefore, the actual requirement is much higher than 16000. In order to achieve this goal, it has been decided to set up new eye care units with the help of corporate sector. These new units would then be handed over to NGOs who would run them. For example, Tata Group has agreed to fund setting up of 10 new eye hospitals. Similarly Reliance group has agreed for"

The most common cause of post-transplant nephropathies in adults is polyomavirus infectionQ.
Infection occurs early after transplantation but may also occur late (>1 year), often associated with immunosuppression intensification to treat acute rejection.
Polyomaviruses have been implicated in several human diseases including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy caused by JC virus & nephroparalysis caused by BK virusQ.
Nephropathy usually develops within weeks to months after kidney transplantionQ.
It typically manifests clinically as an abrupt decline in graft function accompanied by oliguria, hematuria, proteinuria, azotemia, and tubulointerstitial inflammation on biopsy.
Treatment consists of reduction of immunosuppession therapy followed by antiviral treatment such as cidofovir or leflunomide.

Hence, the correct answer is C (Generation 3). (Ref: Sturdevant's art & science of operative dentistry 5th/ep. 310; Textbook of endodontics by K S NARAYAN REDDY 6th/e p. 55)
Apex locators have been classified into four generations:

The first generation was introduced in early 1970s with the introduction of the ""Root-Zone Indicator"" which used an alternating current to measure resistance between two electrodes placed on the tooth surface.

In second-generation devices, direct contact between the electrode tips and root canal walls is required. The most commonly known device within this group is the “Endo Analyzer” developed by Ingevate Corporation. This unit uses a low-frequency AC signal that measures impedance at different frequencies when it contacts hard tissue versus soft tissue.

Third-generation instruments do not require physical contact with the root canal wall but instead use a high frequency electrical field generated around the file tip. These units typically operate using a DC source and measure changes in voltage drop across the instrument caused by its proximity to the apical constriction. Examples include the Root Canal Measuring Instrument (RCMI), the Apex Locator ("

### Response:
 g Ortho-ethyl benzoate is used to replace eugenole in ZOE cements.

Ref: Phillips Ed 12th P: 357
Hence, the correct answer is D (Ortho-ehtyl acid). Explanation: Zinc phosphate cement contains phosphoric acid instead of eugenols. It has been shown that ortho ethyl benzoates can substitute for eugenoles in these materials without loss of strength or biocompatibility.
Hence it is also known as modified ZOE.
Zinc oxide–eugenol (ZOE)
The first dental restorative material containing both an organic component and water was introduced in 1837 by Colgate & Company under the name “Colgate’s Dental Cement.” The original formula contained zinc oxide, gum benzoin, olive oil, and turpentine. In 1864, Dr. G.V. Black recommended using this type of cement with rosin rather than gum benzion because of its greater adhesive properties. This mixture became widely accepted throughout the United States until the introduction of silicate cement in 1906.

Enthalpy Change (ΔH)
The heat evolved during reaction per mole of reactant consumed at constant pressure is called enthalphv change. It can be positive (+ve), negative (- ve) or zero. If ΔH >0 then it means that there will be absorption of heat by system so endothermic reactions have positive values of ΔH. On the other hand if ΔH < 0 then there will release of heat into surroundings so exothermic reaction has negative values of DH.

### Response:
 g. Stapes footplate is fixed by otosclerotic focus which causes conductive deafness. It can be seen on CT scan. The bone conduction threshold will increase due to fixation of ossicles but air conduction remains normal because it depends upon mobility of ossicular chain. In this case there is no improvement in speech discrimination when noise level increases (better in noisy background). This feature differentiates otoscleosis from sensorineural hearing loss where speech discrimination improves in noisy surroundings. Ref : Dhingra; 6th edition; Page no: 28

### Response:
 g B i.e., Rotavirus

Rotaviruses cause watery diarrhoea in infants & children (especially <5 years of age).
The disease usually begins abruptly with vomiting followed by profuse watery non-bloody diarrhoeas without fever.
Dehydration occurs rapidly because of fluid loss through vomitus & stool.

""Most common cause of severe dehydrating diarrhoeal illness in young children →> Rotavirus""
""The major pathogens associated with acute gastroenteritis in children include rotavirus, adenovirus, Norwalk virus, astroviruses, caliciviruses & coronavirus"". - Harrison

### Response:
 g A i.e., Drug Inventory
Hence, the correct answer is A (Drug inventory). (Ref: Park's Textbook of PSM 22nd edition page no 852)
ABC Analysis - It is used to classify items in terms of their value with a view to concentrate on those that are most valuableQ.
VED Analysis - Is an extension of ABC analysis where ""E"" stands for Extraordinary items which have very high values but low frequency of use & ""D"" stands for Danger Items which have low values but frequent usage.
It helps in deciding whether stock should be kept or not.
The main aim of both these techniques is to reduce cost by reducing wastage & increasing efficiency.
These methods can also be applied to drug inventory control in hospitals & dispensaries.
Hence it is useful in controlling drugs in health care system.

### Response:
 g Myofunctionals appliances are used in mixed dentition to correct skeletal problems of jaw growth by altering muscle function.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Mixed dentition). (Ref: Orthodontics: Diagnosis & Management of Malocclusion & Dentofacial Deformities 3rd edition page no 107)
Orthodontic treatment can be divided into two phases:

Phase I

Treatment during primary dentition phase.

It includes correction of malocclusions that occur due to abnormal development of jaws and teeth during this period. The aim of Phase-I orthodontic therapy is to establish good oral habits, improve aesthetics and create an environment conducive to normal eruption of permanent teeth. Treatment modalities include functional appliances such as activator, monobloc, reverse Hawley retainer with lip bumper, headgear etc. These appliances work on the principle of changing the vector of force applied to the mandible so that it grows more forward and upward thereby correcting Class II relationship between maxilla and mandible. This type of treatment is usually completed when the first molars have erupted i.e., around age 8-9 years. If there is need for further treatment after completion of Phase I, then patient has to wait until all the second molars erupt before"

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 gplaster of Paris is calcium sulphate hemihydrate which on hydration forms gypsum plaster.
Reference- Sturdevant’s art & science of operative dentistry. Page no 6th edition pg 7
Hence, the correct answer is C (CaSO4   • 1/2 H2O). (-a). White model plaster contains 100 parts by weight of anhydrous calcium sulfate and 5 parts of potassium sulfate. The remainder consists of water and small amounts of sodium chloride and glycerin. It has been found that when this mixture is dried at room temperature it will retain sufficient moisture in its composition so that upon subsequent addition of water it can be mixed into a workable paste without loss of strength. This type of material is called “dry-mix” plaster because it does not require the use of liquid plaster prior to application. When dry-mix plaster is added to water, the resulting mix should have a consistency similar to thin cream. If too much water is added, the set product may become weak; if insufficient water is present, the setting time will be prolonged.

### Response:
 g B i.e., Nalaxone Opioids (morphine & fentanyl) can cause respiratory depression during labour which is treated by naloxaneQ. Morphine crosses placenta but its action on fetus is minimal because it has very sho half life. It does not cross blood brain barrier to affect respiration. However morphine causes meconium staining due to increased peristalsis. Meperidine also known as pethidine is used commonly for pain relief during delivery. Its metabolite normeperidin produces CNS excitation and tremors in neonates. Therefore it is contraindicated in pregnancy. Pethidine may produce postpaum hemorrhage therefore it is avoided in last few weeks of pregnancy. Butorphanol is an agonistic-antagonist with high affinity for K receptor - less risk of respiratory depression. It is preferred over pure opioids like fentanyl. The most common side effect is nausea and vomiting. Methadone is long acting synthetic narcotic that is paicularly useful when treating chronic pain. Because methadone's duration of action is longer than morphine, dosing needs to be adjusted more slowly. Metha done is often used in detoxification programs for heroin addiction.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g D i.e., Intensity Of Stimulus
Hence, the correct answer is D (Intensity of stimulus). (Ref: Ganong's physiology 22nd edition Page no 55)
Weber - Fechner Law states that ""the magnitude of sensation produced by doubling the intensity of a stimulus is equal to the original sensation"". This means that if you double the weight on your finger tip, it will feel twice heavier than before but this does not mean that the actual force felt in the skin has doubled. The same applies to light; when its brightness is increased two fold, we perceive it as being twice brighter. In general, the amount of change in subjective experience required to detect an increase in physical stimuli depends upon the initial level of stimulation. For example, one milliamperage current may be barely noticeable at first, but increasing it to 2 mA produces a very marked difference in perception. On the other hand, a strong sound may have to be made louder by several decibels before the change becomes apparent. Thus, according to the law, the greater the strength of a sensory stimulus, the less sensitive we become to fuher increases in its intensity. It also implies that our ability to sense changes in a stimulus decreases with higher intensities of the"

### Response:
  You can calculate NF by subtracting interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure (pIGc) from capsular hydrostatic pressure (PGC). The same formula applies to renal corpuscle of glomerulus. Therefore, NF = PGc - pIGc = 32-2 =30mmHg
Hence, the correct answer is A (34 mm Hz). (Ref: Ganong review of medical physiology 23rd edition pg 655)
Net Filtration Pressure in Glomeruli

The forces favoring filtration include:

Capsular hydrostatic pressure (PGc): This is the blood pressure within the capillaries of the glomeruli. It averages approximately 36 mm Hgt.

Interstitial fluid coloid osmotic pressures (Pigc): These are caused by plasma proteins such as albumin and globulins. They oppose filtration because they tend to keep water inside the vessels. In normal circumstances, this value is very low, averaging less than 1 mm Hgi.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g The mental foramen lies in front of the second premolar tooth at the level of free margin of the lower lip. It transmits inferior alveolar nerve and vessels to supply the skin and mucous membrane of the chin. The genial tuberosity forms the anterior end of mylohydroid line which runs obliquely downwards and backwards across the inner aspect of ramus. The lingual plate has an upper concave area called the lingua that projects upwards into the floor of the mouth. This gives attachment to the sublingual gland. Ref BDC volume3,sixth edition pg 216

### Response:
 g
Explanation: Michaelis constant (Km): It is defined as the substrate concentration that produces one-half Vmax. In simple words it can be said to be the affinity between enzyme & its substrate. Higher the Km lower will be the affinities b/w enzyme & substrate. Lower the Km higher will be affininity b/w them. 
Reference- Harper’s illustrated biochemistry 31st edition Pg no. 25
Hence, the correct answer is C (The substrate concentration at half maximal velocity). (Ref: Harper's Biochemistry, 30th Ed page 26)
Also Know-
Michaelis-Menten equation:

V = V max / K m + S

Where,
S – Substrate Concentration
Vm - Maximum Velocity

### Response:
 g Thiamin diphosphate (TDP), also known as thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP), is the coenzyme form of vitamin B1 that plays an essential role in carbohydrate metabolism. It acts as a cofactor for several enzymes involved in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and gluconeogenesis. The most important enzyme reaction catalyzed by TDP is transketolation, which transfers a two-carbon unit to acceptor molecules such as ribose-5-phosphate, forming sedoheptulose-7-phosphate. This step occurs during both the oxidative phase of the pentos ephosphate pathway and the nonoxidative stage of glycol ysis. In addition, TPP serves as a prosthetic group for the decarboxylases of the branched-chain amino acids leucine, l-isoleucine, and valine. These reactions occur at the beginning of their catabolic pathways. Finally, TPP functions with flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as a redox couple in the oxidative decar boxylation of L-a-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenases, including those found in the pyruvate dehydro genase complex and α-ketoglutar"

Hence, the correct answer is C (--61 m V). (-ve sign indicates that it is an inhibitory neurotransmitter). (Ref : Guyton & Hall textbook of medical physiology 12th edition page no.55)
Hence A is incorrect
HENCE THE ANSWER IS C i.e., -61 MV
Explanation: The Nerns t equation can he used to calculate the equilibrium potential for any type of ion in a cell membrane. This equation states that when all chemical gradients have been eliminated except those due to one particular ion species, then the electrical gradient required to prevent movement of that ion across the membrane equals Eeq =-61 logl0nCi/nCl where n is the valency of the ion, Ci is its intracellular concentration, and Co is its extracellular concentration. If Cl- were distributed equally on both sides of the membrane, so that Ci=Co, there would be no electrochemical gradient for CI-, and therefore no net flow of current through the membrane. In such case, the value of Eeq would equal zero millivolts. However, if the concentrations of ions inside and outside the fiber differ, then there must be some electromotive force present between"

X-Ray Tube Components

Filaments (cathodes): These consist of tungsten wire coated on both ends with barium oxide to increase their emissivity. They operate at temperatures around 2800°C. When heated they emit large numbers of free electrons into space. This process is known as thermionic emission.

Anodes: Anodes may take one of three forms:

1. Solid targets made up of tungstun alloy containing rhenium (W-Re).

2. Glass discs coated with barite sulphate (BaSO4), calcium tungstate (CaWO4) or rare earth phosphates such as lanthanum triphosphate"

### Response:
 g) Recurrent abdominal pain is defined as recurrent episodes of severe enough pain that interferes with daily activities at least once per week over a period of 12 weeks.

Etiology

Functional disorders (most common)
Hence, the correct answer is B (Emotional/behavourial problems). Explanation: Functional Abdominal Pain Syndrome - The term functional refers to symptoms which do not have an identifiable organic cause. It includes Irritable Bowel syndrome, Migrainous Abdomen, Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome, Nausea & vomiting, Chronic Abdominopelvic Pain Syndrome, Nonulcer Dyspepsia etc. These conditions account for approximately half of all cases of chronic abdominal pain seen by pediatricians. In these patients there may be normal findings on physical examination, laboratory tests, radiographic studies, endoscopy, manometry, colonoscopy and even laparotomy. There is no evidence of inflammation, infection, tumor growth, obstruction, malrotation, volvulus, intussusception, appendicitis, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux, constipation, urinary tract infections, nephrolithiasis, sickle cell crisis, postural hypotension, p"

### Response:
 g
Explanation: Ans. C. HDLPark's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine 23rd edition page no- 645The major function of HDL is to act as a reverse lipoprotein by removing free (unesterified)cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues and returning it to liver for excretion into bile.HDL also acts as an antiatherogenic lipid transport system because it removes excess unesterifiedcholesterols from peripheral tissue cells which otherwise would be esterified within these cells with fattyacids to form cholesteryl esters and thus get deposited in arterial walls leading to formation offibrous plaques.
Hence, the correct answer is C (HDL). (Ref: Park's textbook of preventive and social medicine 21st ed pg 644)

### Response:
 g Ultrasound (Ref: Nelson's 20/e p 1911-1920)
Ultrasound is the preferred initial imaging modality to evaluate patients with suspected Acute Appendicitis because it does not expose them to radiation.
""Ultrasonography has become the first-line imaging study of choice for evaluation of pediatric patients who present with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute appendicits. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonographic diagnosis of acute apendicitis have been reported to be between 80% and 100%. Ultrasonography can also identify alternative causes of abdominal pain such as intussusception, Meckel diverticulum, choledocholithiasis, urinary tract obstruction, ovarian cysts, pancreatic pseudocysts, mesenteric adenitis, and inguinal hernia."" - Nelson's
""The use of CT scanning in the assessment of acute right lower quadrant pain should be limited to those cases where ultrasound findings are equivocal and clinical judgment remains uncertain regarding the presence or absence of acute disease. In addition, CT scans may reveal an alternate cause for the patient's symptoms that would obviate the need for surgery.""

### Response:
 g C i.e., 2 - 6 year
Hence, the correct answer is C (2-5 years). (Ref : Nelson's Textbook of Pediatrics 17th /e p. 65; Ghai essential pediatrics 8/e p.10)
Hence children between age group 2 to 6 yrs fall in Preoperational stage according to Piaget theory.
Pre-operational Stage (Age 2–6 Years)

The child learns language during this phase but uses it egocentrically.
Egocentrism refers to inability to take another person’s point of view.
Children at this stage have difficulty in separating their own thoughts from reality.

Sensory-motor stage

This stage begins with birth and ends by approximately two years of age.
During this time, infants learn through sensory experiences and motor activities that allow them to interact with objects in their environment.
Infants begin to understand object permanence around six months of age, which means they realize that an object continues to exist even when it cannot be seen or directly sensed.
They also develop hand preference during this time.
Piaget divided sensorimotor into four substages:

### Response:
 ganser syndrome (also known as pseudodementia, pseudo dementia of organic brain disease, or confabulatory insanity) is an unusual dissociative disorder in which patients give approximate answers to questions that they do not know. It was first described by Sigbert Ganser in 1898. The symptoms include clouding of consciousness, hallucinations, delusions, amnesia, and confusion. Patients with this condition may also have a form of confabulation called ""Ganser's syndrome"" where they fill gaps in their memory with information that sounds plausible but is actually false. This can be difficult to distinguish from lying. In some cases, it has been linked to prolonged interrogation techniques used on prisoners. There is no clear cause for ganser syndromes; however, several theories exist. One theory suggests that these disorders occur when there is damage to pas of the brain such as the frontal lobe. Another theory states that people who suffer from gansers develop them because of extreme stress caused by events like imprisonment. Some researchers believe that ganseresyndrome occurs due to a combination of both factors. Treatment varies depending upon what type of gansere syndrome one suffers from. If the patient develops the syndrome after being imprisoned, then treatment would focus"

### Response:
 g A (Interstitial cells of cajal) Ref: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology, 22nd editionExplanation:Intestinal smooth muscles have spontaneous rhythmic fluctuations in membrane potential between -65 mV (resting level) & -45 mV called slow waves.These slow waves originate in interstitial cells that resemble pacemaker cells found in SA node.They spread to intestinal smooth muscles by way of gap junctions formed by connexin proteins.The frequency of these slow waves is higher in proximal small bowel than distally.In stomach they occur at rate of 3-5/minIn duodenum it occurs at rate 12/minIn jejunum it occurs around 8-9 /minIn ileum it is less frequent at 6/minThe amplitude of slow waves increases with increasing distance along the gut until maximum value is reached near the end of the organ concerned.After this point, there is progressive decline in amplitude towards terminal portion of the gut.Slow waves can be recorded using intramural electrodes inserted into wall of gastrointestinal tract.Potentials generated during action potentials superimposed on top of slow wave are known as spike potentials.Action potentials are initiated when threshold voltage (-55mV) is attained during upstroke phase of slowwave.This results in contraction"

 gans in the body is called nervous system. The pa of it that transmits information to and from the brain is known as peripheral nerves. There are two types of cells found within these nerves: motor neurons (also referred to as efferent nerve fibers), which carry signals away from the central nervous system; and sensory neurons (or afferent fibers),which transmit sensations toward the CNS. Motor neurons innervate muscles and glands while sensory neurons respond to stimuli such as light touch, pain, temperature changes, vibration, pressure, itchiness, taste, smell, hearing, balance, vision, etc. Ref - BDC vol-2 pg no-8

### Response:
 g Cytosines that occur within CG dinucleotides (CGs), which constitute approximately 1% of all base pairs in mammalian genomes, are more frequently methylated than those found outside these sequences. The methylation is usually symmetric with respect to both strands of the double helix; however, it can be asymmetric when there is no maintenance methylation during cell division. In mammals, most genes have their promoter regions located near CpG-rich areas called CpG Islands. These are often unmethylated in normal cells but hypermethylated by cancerous transformation. This epigenetic change prevents transcription factors binding to gene promoters and thus represses gene expression. Ref - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin#Euchromatin_and_heterochromatin
Hence, the correct answer is A (Methylation). (Ref : Wikipedia)

It also runs just above the center of the plica labialis inferioris on either side. This line represents the level where the lips rest in repose. 
The upper teeth should be visible by approximately 3–5 mm when viewed with the mouth closed; this space is called overbite. When the mandible moves forward during mastication, it will occlude into centric relation position, which is defined as “the relationship between maxilla and mandible such that their condyles articulate with the thinnest portion of the articular disc.” Centric relation can occur anywhere along the vertical axis of rotation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). However, because the TMJs have different axes of rotation, they do not always meet exactly in the same place. Therefore, there may be more than one possible centric jaw relationship. To ensure proper alignment of the dental arches, dentists must determine the correct centric relationship of the jaws before making impressions of the patient’s teeth. If done incorrectly, the resulting"

The polymerization reaction between liquid methyl methacrylate monomers and powder components results in formation of poly(methylmethacrylates), which constitute most denture base materials. The chemical structure of these polymers consists of long chains of molecules that have double bonds within their molecular framework. When exposed to heat, light, or chemicals, such double bonds can be broken down by depolymerization reactions, resulting in degradation of the material. This process causes loss of mechanical properties and discoloration of the denture bases. 
In addition, when excess amounts of monomeric liquids are used during processing, they do not react with all available sites on the filler particles but instead remain unreacted throughout the final product. These residual monomers leach out over time and cause softening of the surface layer of the finished prosthesis. In extreme cases, this phenomenon has been referred to as “sweating” because it appears like perspiration on the surface of the prostheses.

The firing process consists of heating the powder mixture at high temperature until vitrification occurs. The first firing is called bisque firing; this removes excess water content and produces a hard surface that prevents further moisture absorption by the body during subsequent firings. A second firing with glaze material completes the ceramic restoration.

Firing Process

The firing cycle can vary depending on the type of oven used. However, most ovens have three stages:

1st stage - Bisquing
This initial firing takes place between 900°C and 1000°C. It serves two purposes: 

It burns out all organic materials such as waxes, lubricants, and plasticizers completely without leaving behind any residue. This step also causes dehydration of the feldspathic powders resulting in loss of weight up to 10%. 
It creates a dry glassy surface which acts as an impermeable barrier preventing further moisture penetration into the interior of the structure during subsequent firing cycles. This helps in achieving uniform shrinkage throughout the"

Space Requirements Determination Methods

In order to plan an effective treatment strategy it is essential that we have some idea regarding the amount of space available for eruption of permanent successor teeth. The various methods employed for this purpose can be broadly divided into two groups:

1. Those requiring radiographic examination of the dental arches prior to the eruption of first molar i.e., before age 6 years; these are known as pre-molar eruption methods.

2. Those based on clinical observation after the eruption if first molars; these may also be called post-molar eruptions methods.

### Response:
 g. The dNTPs (dATP, dGTP, dCTP & TTP) are required to synthesize new strands during PCR. They act as substrates for DNA synthesis by DNA polymerases. In this process, they get incorporated into growing strand at appropriate sites according to base pairing rules. So, dNMPs are essential components of PCR reactions. On the other hand, ddNTPS do not have 3' OH group on their sugar moiety. Therefore, these cannot be incorporated into elongating DNA chains because there will be no bond between them with next incoming nucleotide. Hence, they can serve as terminators of DNA replication. These are also called as Chain termination agents. For example, when dideoxycytidine triphosphate (ddCTP), which lacks its 3'-OH groups, enters an elongation step it terminates the extension of the nascent complementary DNA strand being synthesized. This results in shortening of all newly formed cDNA molecules so that they contain different lengths of sequence information. When analyzed using electrophoresis, these fragments form bands corresponding to specific sizes. By comparing band patterns obtained after labeling one end of the fragment with radioactive phosphate, researchers can determine where along the target gene"

Explanation: The most common type of PTM involves covalent modifications to specific residues in proteins such as phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, proteolytic processing, glycosylations etc. These types of PTMs can alter protein function by changing their activity, localization, interactions with other molecules, stability, folding, translocation across membranes, and subcellular distribution. In addition, some enzymes undergo conformation changes upon binding substrates which may be required for catalysis.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 giving answer in reference to Harrison's principles of internal medicine 19th edition pg no. 356 * The primary disturbance is respiratory alkalosis (low PCO2). Compensation occurs within minutes by renal retention of bicarbonate; this can be detected on ABG after several hours. A normal anion gap metabolic acidosis develops secondary to loss of bicarbonates. This compensatory process will restore the pH toward normal but does not correct the underlying disorder. Ref : Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19e chapter 49.
Hence, the correct answer is A (Respiratory alkalasis). (Ref: Harrison's principle of internalmedicine - 18/e page 344 table 46-1)
The primary disturbance in the above case is respiratory Alkalosis because CO2 level is low which causes increase in pH. So compensation should occur towards acidic side i.e., decrease in HCO3-
In metabolic disorders there is change in H+ concentration due to changes in Bicarbontes levels whereas in respiratory disorders it is due to change in CO2 levels.
So if we see the values of CO2 & HCO32-, they both are changing in opposite direction so that pH remains constant.

### Response:
 gypsum products undergo continued changes in their physical properties until they reach an equilibrium with their environment. This is called flow.

Ref: Phillips Ed 12th P: 53
Hence, the correct answer is A (Continued change of...). (Note-Flow of a set gypsum product means that it continues to deform slowly over time due to continued hydration).
The term ""flow"" has been used by some investigators to describe the deformation of a specimen subjected to constant stress at room temperature. It may be defined as the ratio between strain and applied stress. In this sense, flow can occur even after setting; however, such behavior is undesirable because it results in dimensional instability of the finished prosthesis.

### Response:
 g C i.e., Morphological Differentiation
Hence, the correct answer is C (Morpho differentiation). (Ref: Textbook of orthodontics Sridhar Premkumar 2nd edition page no-5)
The stages in development of teeth are:

Histogenesis - The process by which cells differentiate into specialized tissuesQ
Calcification - It begins at cervical loop & extends to cusp tipQ
Apposition - Is deposition of minerals on organic matrixQ
Root resorption - Begins with root calcification & continues till completion of eruptionQ

Note: In morphodifferentation, shape of tooth is formed due to differential growth rates of different parts of enamel organ & dental papilla.
Hence it is also called morphogenetic field.
It occurs after histodiffrentiation.
So, Size of tooth = Histodiffrenatiaon + Shape of tooth= Morphodifferentiatin
Thus, during morphodifferntiation, size of tooth remains same but its shape changes.

Question: A 30 year old female is on antibiotics with prolonged IV cannulation, has spike of fever, the likely cause is :
Options:
A) Pseudomonas aerugenosa
B) Coagulase negative staphylococcus
C) Streptococcus agalactiae
D) E. coli
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g B i.e., Coagulasenegative Staphyloccocus
Hence, the correct answer is B (Coagulose negative stahvlocccus). (+)ve blood culture in an intravenous catheter tip should be considered positive if there is no obvious contamination by skin floraQ. The most common organism isolated is coagulases-negative staphycocci such as S.aureus, S.hominis & epidermidisQ. Other organisms that may also grow include diphtheroids, propionibacterium acnes, bacilli, micrococci, corynebacteria, gram-negative rods, fungi, yeasts, viruses, mycobacteria, legionella, brucella, Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia species, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Rhodotorula rubra, Trichosporon cutaneum, Fusarium solani, Penicillium spp., Zygomycetes, Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis, Sporothrix"

Question: Best test that shows the integrity of intrinsic pathway of clotting mechanism
Options:
A) bleeding time
B) aPTT
C) prothrombin time
D) clotting time
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g B i.e., aPTTRemember- PT is used to assess extrinsic system & PTT (aPTT) is used for intrinsic systemQ.Bleeding Time - It measures platelet functionClotting time - It tests both coagulation factors & fibrinolysisProthrombintime - Tests factor Vlll, IX, X, II (prothrom-bin), vWF, fibrinogenAPTT - Test all components except prekallikrein, HMW kininogen, XII, XI, VIII:C, VIIICoagulogram - Measures all parameters including Fibrinolytic activity
Hence, the correct answer is B (aP TT). (Ref: Robbins 8/e p120; Harrison's 17/e p160)
Note : The activated partial thromboplastin time (a.P.T.T.) is an in vitro assay designed to evaluate the integrity and efficiency of the intrinsic and common pathways of blood coagula­tion. This test evaluates the ability of plasma to generate thrombin when mixed with tissue factor and phospholipid reagents. In this procedure, citrated plasma is incubated at 37°C with calcium ions, kaolin, ellagic acid,"
