X linked severe combined immunodeficiency

Most common form of primary immunodeficiencies
Caused due to mutation in genes encoding components of cytokine receptor complex that regulate T cell development & function.

Gamma C Chain Deficiency 

Mutation in the gene encoding the common gamma chain shared by several receptors including interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-7, IL-9, IL15 & IL21 Receptors.
This results in failure of V(DJ recombination leading to absence of mature B cells & NK Cells.

### Response:
 g. Contrast-Induced Nephrotoxicity (CIN)
Hence, the correct answer is C (Obesity). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine - 18th edition, Page 308; Radiology Review Manual By Wolfgang Dahnert, 6th Edition, Page No: 1010).
Contrast Induced Nefrotoxicty

The most common cause of AKI in hospitalized patients is radiocontrast agents used during angiography or CT scanning.
Risk factors include pre-existing renal disease, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, multiple myeloma with light chain proteinuria, volume depletion, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Pathophysiology:

Radiocontrast agents can be divided into two categories based on their osmolality: high-osmolar contrast media (HOCM), which have an osmolal gap of approximately 2900 mOsm/kg water, and low-osmolarity contrast media (LOCM), which has an osmal gap of < 900 mOSm/L water.
In addition to differences in osmolatility, there are also different types of contrast agents that may affect kidney function differently. These include iodinated contrast agents such as iohexol"

Question: A hypeensive patient was on metoprolol treatment. Verapamil was added to the therapy of this patient. This can result in
Options:
A) Atrial fibrillation
B) Bradycardia with AV block
C) Torsades de pointes
D) Tachycardia
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. (Ref: KDT 6/e p535; Katzung 10th/ e p190-191)Metoprol is beta blocker which decreases heart rate by decreasing sympathetic stimulation whereas verapamal acts directly on calcium channels present at SA node causing decrease in conduction velocity - both together will cause bradycardias and AV blocks.Torsade's de pointe occurs due to prolongation of QT interval caused by drugs like quinidine, sotalol etc.Atrial fibrillations occur when there is increased sympathetic activity.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Bradycardial with AV Block). (Ref::KDT 5/e p536; Goodman & Gilman 11/e p1720)The combination of b-blockers and CCBs should be avoided because they may produce excessive depression of myocardial contractility and severe bradyarrhythmias.Combination of two anti-hypeensives increases risk of hypotension and syncope.Beta blockers reduce cardiac output and peripheral resistance while vasodilators increase it. Therefore their combined use results in marked fall in BP.

Hinduism beliefs on death & afterlife Hinduism believes that there is an existence before birth and another one after death. It also believes that the soul transmigrates into different bodies according to its accumulated ""karmas"" which means actions of past life. Death marks the end of one cycle of rebirth but not the ultimate end of individual existence. Reincarnation occurs when the Atman (soul), attains moksha (liberation) by escaping the cycle of samsara (rebirth).
Hence it is clear that Hindus believe in reincarnation and do not fear death because they consider it as just transition from one body to another.
The concept of reincarnation has been explained beautifully through the example of a river flowing continuously with water molecules changing all along the way. Similarly, the soul keeps moving from one form to another till liberation is attained.
In this context, death becomes a natural process like growth, decay and renewal. This view helps people cope better with loss and"

### Response:
 g% 
Hence, the correct answer is A (10.5 gm%). (Ref: Textbook of Obstetrics D.C.Dutta 6th edition page no. 310). Anemia during Pregnancy - Definition & Classification
Hence the correct Answer is B (11.5 gms %). (Ref : Dutta's textbook of obstetrics 7th ed, pg 311)
Hence it is incorrect. The closest answer would be 11-11.50gm%. So we can go with that.
Hence there is no unique answer to this question.
Explanation: Diagnosis of Iron Deficiency Anaemia in Pregnancy
The diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia requires demonstration of reduced haemoglobin concentration below 110g/L at sea level (<100g/L above 2000m), together with evidence of depleted body iron stores. This may be done by demonstrating low serum ferritin levels (<15mg/L).
Reference: William’s Obstetrics; 25th edition

### Response:
 gans (Somatic effects): These occur due to direct damage caused by ionizing radiations on cells and tissues resulting in mutations leading to abnormal cell growth and neoplasia. The somatic genetic changes that result in carcinogenesis may be either inherited or acquired during life time. Inherited gene mutation is responsible for familial cancers such as retinoblastoma, Wilms tumour, breast carcinoma etc. Acquired somatic mutations can also lead to malignancy. For example, p53 tumor suppressor gene plays an impoant role in preventing uncontrolled cell division. Mutation in this gene has been found in many human tumors including lung, colon, liver, kidney, bladder, brain, ovary, skin and lymphoid tissue. Radiation exposure causes DNA damage which leads to point mutations, chromosomal aberration and translocations. Such alterations in genes involved in control of cell proliferation can cause malignant transformation. Ref : Park's Textbook Of Preventive And Social Medicine; 24th edition - Page no. 672

 g D i.e., Cell fixed lgE
Hence, the correct answer is D (Cell fixed IgE). (Ref Robbins 8/e p59)
Basophilis have receptors for cell bound IgE on their surface which can be cross linked with antigen to cause degranulation of basopilic leucocytes resulting in release of histamine & serotoninQ.
The major stimulus for eosinophilia is IL-5 secreted by T cellsQ.
Neutrophills do not fix complement but they may bind C3b that has been deposited on microorganismsQ.
Killer inhibitory factor prevents lysis of target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocyteQ.
Hence it is also known as CD55 protein.
It acts through membrane attack complex inhibitor protein (MACIP).
CD56 is an adhesion molecule present on NK cellsQ.

 ganser syndrome (also known as pseudodementia, hysterical dementia, or la belle indifférence) is a condition in which patients present with symptoms that mimic those of organic brain disease such as dementia, delirium, amnesia, aphasia, agnosia, apraxia, hallucinations, and convulsions. The patient may also feign physical illness, blindness, deafness, paralysis, seizures, coma, etc., called Munchausen's syndrome. It can be seen after head injury, encephalitis, intracranial surgery, multiple sclerosis, alcoholism, schizophrenia, depression, conversion disorder, dissociative fugue state, post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, factitious disorders, somatoform pain disorder, hypochondriasis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and autism spectrum disorders. Ganser's syndrome has been described to occur during imprisonment, torture, war time, famine, extreme poverty, severe emotional trauma, abuse, neglect, and prolonged isolation. In some cases it occurs without apparent cause. Patients often have a history of previous psychiatric problems including substance use disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic episodes, and antisocial behavior."

### Response:
 g D i.e. Centropetal spikiesCentro temporal spike & wave discharges (CTSWDs) are benign focal epilepsies that occur in children between ages 3-13 years old. The most common presentation is simple partial seizures characterized by sudden jerking movements of one hand or foot. These can be provoked by stress such as an exam. They may also present with atonic drops of the head or upper extremities without loss of awareness. Consciousness remains intact throughout the episode. Seizures usually last less than 10 seconds and do not recur within minutes. No treatment is required unless they interfere with daily activities. If needed, valproate is effective but carries risk of hepatotoxicity. Genetic studies have shown familial inheritance patterns; however, there is no clear genetic marker. CTSWDs on EEG show sharp waves arising from centro-temporal regions bilaterally. In some cases, these will evolve into bilateral synchronous spike-wave activity lasting up to several seconds. This pattern does not indicate absences because patients remain aware and able to respond appropriately. MRI should rule out structural lesions if clinical features suggest otherwise. Prognosis is excellent with complete remission occurring after pubey.

### Response:
 g Nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanyl cyclase in vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in increased levels of cGMP and vasodilation. The NO produced by nitrates also inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion. Nitrates do not cause tachyphylaxis because they release NO continuously rather than all at once like organic nitrated compounds such as amyl nitrite. However, tolerance can develop with chronic use due to downregulation of receptors on vascular smooth muscles. Tolerance does not occur when used intermittently, e.g., prn for angina pectoris.

### Response:
 g C i.e., Lysozome
Hence, the correct answer is C (Lysozymes). (Ref Robbins 8/e p55)
The phagocytosis of bacteria by neutrophils results in formation of phagosomes which fuse with lysosome to form phagolysosomesQ. The fusion occurs because both have common membrane component. Phagolvsosomes contain lysozymese that cleaves peptidoglycan present on bacterial cell wall resulting in lysis of microbe.
Hence it is also known as bacteriolvse.
Note : Phagocytes can kill ingested organisms through several mechanisms including:

1. Enzymatic destruction within the phagocyte,
2. Production of toxic oxygen metabolites such as superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical & hypochlorous acid, &
3. Release of granules containing enzymes like elastases, cathepsins etc.

These mechanisms may act alone or together to destroy microbial pathogens.

### Response:
 g. ACL injury occurs when there is hyperextension of knee along with external rotation of tibia on femur (eg : twisting injuries). It can also occur due to direct blow to lateral aspect of proximal tibia. In this case, the mechanism of injury was an indirect one i.e., twisting force which caused excessive internal rotation of the tibia relative to the femur. As such, posterolateral bundle of ACL would be more likely affected than antero-medial bundle. Ref: Textbook of Ohopedics By J Maheswari page 214-215.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Anteromedially pa of posterior cruciate Ligament). (Ref: Text book of ohopaedics by John Ebnezar - Page no. 216)
The anterior cruciatae ligaments consist of two bundles :- Anatomical (anteromedial) & functional (posterolateral).
Injury to these structures causes loss of stability of the knee joint especially during extension.
This type of injury usually results from sudden deceleration or valgus stress combined with internal rotation.
It may result from direct trauma to the lateral side of the proximal end of the fibula or from forced hyperflexion of the extended leg.

The optimal gestational age at which to deliver an infant whose mother has preexisting diabetes mellitus remains controversial. The risks associated with continuing pregnancies beyond term include fetal macrosomia, increased perinatal mortality, cesarean delivery rates, shoulder dystocia, birth injury, neonatal hypoglycemia, polycythemia, hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory distress syndrome, and long-term neurologic sequelae. On the other hand, earlier deliveries may result in low bih weight infants who have higher morbidity and moality than those born at later gestations. In general, it appears that fetuses of diabetic mothers do better when delivered between 32 and 36 weeks' gestation. However, this recommendation must be individualized based on specific circumstances such as maternal health status, degree of glycemic control, presence of complications, and fetal well-being. Delivery before 28 weeks carries significant risk of death and serious disability. Therefore, every attempt should be made to continue these pregnancies until they reach viability.

Valproic acid causes weight gain and hyperammonemia in old age. Levetiractem may cause behavioral changes like aggression and psychosis. Pregabaline also causes sedation and drowsiness.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Oxcarbaz epine). (but it should have been mentioned that both oxcarbamazepine & levitracetum could be used).
The most common side effects associated with carbamazepine include nausea, vomiting, ataxia, diplopia, headache, blurred vision, edema, constipation, rash, hirsutism, hair loss, alopecia, hyponatremia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, liver failure, pancreatitis, and AML/MDS.

 g A (Pubococccygeus) : The pubococciygens muscle is one of three muscles that make up the pelvic diaphragm. It originates on the posterior surface of the symphysis pubis and inserts into the coccyx and anococ- cygeal raphe. This muscle forms part of the urogenital diaphram along with the transverse cervical ligaments and fascia covering it.The bulbourethral glands lie between this muscle and the membranous poion of the urethrea. In females, the pubococcigens also suppos the vagina and bladder base.Injury to these muscles can lead to prolapse of organs such as the uterus, rectum, and urinary tract. These conditions include uterine prolapse, vaginal vault prolapse and stress incontinence. Other symptoms may be constipation due to weakness of anal sphincters, decreased sexual function, backache, sciatica, and pain during intercourse.Puborectalis muscle - is another impoant component of levator ani muscle complex.It arises from the inner aspect of the obturator membrane just lateral to the arcuate line and inses onto the anterior longitudinal ligament at the level of sacrum.This muscle"

### Response:
 g Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th editionExplanation:Management of HemoptysisThe first step in management of patients presenting with hemoptisis is bronchoscopy.The most common cause of hemoptis is infection (bacterial pneumonia).Infection can be treated by antibiotics.In case of cancer treatment includes chemotherapy/radiotherapy/surgery depending on type of tumor.Other causes include tuberculosis, fungal infections, parasites etc.Treatment depends upon etiology.If no obvious source found then angiography should be performed.Angiographic findings suggest that bleeding arises from pulmonary aeries > bronchial arteries.Pulmonary aeries arise directly from main pulmonary trunk so they have low oxygen saturation compared to systemic circulation.Bronchial artery has high oxygen content because it originates from intercostal aeries.Thus if there is hypoxia present at site of bleed - it suggests origin from pulmonary vessels; otherwise it indicates origin from bronchials.Therefore, selective catheterization & embolisation of these vessels may control hemorrhage.Catheters used are microcatherers like platinum coils, gel foam pledgets, cyanoacrylate glue, autologous clot, gelfoam powder, polyvinyl alcohol particles, Onyx liquid adhesive, microp"

 g Option d i.e., phototherapy Jaundice in the first three days of life suggests hemolytic disease of newborn (HDN). HDN can be ruled out if maternal antibodies do not cross placenta e.g. Rh negative mothers giving birth to Rh negative babies. In all other cases, exchange transfusion should be done within 24 hours of age. If bilirubin levels reach >20 mg/dl after 3-5 days of bih then diagnosis of biliary atresia has to be considered. This requires LFTs & liver biopsy. Physiological jaundine usually stas by third day of bihs and resolves by 7th -10th day.

Hence, the correct answer is D (Due to the high silica content). (Ref : Phillips Ed 12th p-410)
Silicate cement has been shown to be effective against caries because it contains large amounts of SiO2 that reacts with water to form hydrated calcium silicate which precipitates on tooth surface. This reaction reduces demineralization of enamel adjacent to filling margin.

The use of glass ionomer cement (GIC) as restorative material was first described by Wilson & Kent in 1976. It consists of an aluminosilicate glass powder mixed with polyacrylic acid solution. When set, GIC forms a strong bond between tooth structure and luting agent. In addition, they release fluoride ions over long periods of time, thus providing protection against dental decay. They have also been found to inhibit bacterial growth and reduce plaque accumulation around restorations. These properties make them suitable for use as pit-and-fissure sealants and liners.

### Response:
  B. Alpha- 1 antagonist and beta- 2 agonists
Hence, the correct answer is B (Alpha-1 antagonists and beta -2 agonism). (Ref: KDT 7th/e p101). 
Explanation: Drug acts by increasing hea rate and systolic blood pressure due to b1 stimulation while decreasing diastolic blood pressures due to alpha-1 blockade. It also causes tremor which is an adverse effect of sympathomimetic drugs.
Hence it can be concluded that this drug has both alpha blocking activity along with beta stimulating action.
Note: If there was no change in heart rate but increase in SBP & DBP then we would have gone for pure alpha stimulant.
If there were no changes in BP but increased HR & tremors than we would go for beta stimulants.
If all parameters had changed equally i.e., increase in both SBP and DBP along with increase in HR and presence of tremors, then we could say that drug is having mixed action on alpha and beta receptors.

### Response:
 g C i.e., Hyper keratinization of Squamous Epithelium Vitamin A is required to maintain integrity & function of mucous membranesQ (including Conjuctival Mucosa). Deficiency leads to hyper-keratinisation of squamoua epitheliaumQ - which may be associated with loss of mucus secreting glands. This results in dryness, roughening & thickening of corneoscleral junction called Bitot's spotsQ. These changes occur due to decreased synthesis of glycoproteins such as lipo-carotenoids & mucopolysaccharides by deficient vitamin A stores. The most impoant role of retinol is maintenance of normal morphology of conjunctival epithelial cells. It also has an effect on tear film composition. Retinoic acid regulates gene expression involved in differentiation of conjuctival epithelism during embryogenesis. In adult life it maintains homeostasis of conjuntival epitheliunm.

The minimum number of platelets required prior to elective surgical procedures has been controversial. The American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Blood Component Therapy recommends that patients have at least 5,000/mL of circulating platelets before undergoing noncardiac surgery. However, some studies suggest that this threshold may need to be higher than previously thought because even mild thrombocyte dysfunction can lead to postoperative hemorrhage.

### Response:
 g The most common cause of second trimester pregnancy loss (missed abortion) is chromosomal abnormality in fetus. So fetal karyotyping should be done in all cases of midtrimester losses. Recurrent miscarriages can occur due to autoimmune disorders like SLE which causes presence of lupus anti-coagulants and anticardiolips antibodies. These patients have increased risk of thrombosis so they need prophylactic aspirin therapy during their subsequent pregnancies. In case of positive serology, both male and female partner must be tested for syphilis by RPR/VDRL test. Ref : Dutta textbook of obstetrics 7th edition page no 186

 g. Post dated pregnancies can occur in women who have irregular cycles. So review of their past menstrual cycle is essential to rule out this possibility.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Review of previous menstruation). Ref - Williams Obstetrics 24th edition page 1015-1020Explanation:The diagnosis of postterm gestation requires that labor has not begun by 294 days (<2 weeks beyond the date) of the last menstrual period.The most common cause of post term pregnancy is an error in dating the pregnancy.Among those whose dates were confirmed accurately before 20 weeks' gestation, approximately one third will deliver after 41 completed weeks.In general, however, more than half of all patients reach 40 weeks' duration of gestation.Patients should undergo regular surveillance beginning at 39 weeks' estimated gestational age if they do not have risk factors for preterm birth.If there are no fetal concerns on ultrasound examination, then weekly sonograms may be performed until delivery occurs.Post-term fetuses exhibit several characteristic features on ultrasonography.These include decreased amniotic fluid volume; increased placental thickness; and changes in umbilical artery Doppler studies, including absent end-diastolic flow and reversed diastolic blood flow.Fetal biophysical profile"

### Response:
 g C i.e., Aortic Stenosis - The most serious cardiac lesion complicating pregnancy is severe aoic stenosiQ (critical aoic obstruction). It may be congenital or rheumatic in origin. Severe symptoms occur late in first trimester or early second trimester of gestation. Pregnancy should be terminated if there is significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with ejection fraction <50% &/or systolic pressure >120 mmHg at rest. Prognosis depends on severity of disease; patients with mild to moderate lesions do well but those with critical stenoses have high moality rate (>30%). Patients with valvular hea diseases who develop pulmonary hypeension also have poor outcome.

### Response:
 gans (scabiei var hominis). The disease has been known since ancient times; it was described by Hippocrates in his book ""De Morbis Popularibus"". It occurs worldwide but is most common in tropical countries where living conditions are poor. In India scabies affects all age groups equally. However, children below 2 years of age have higher incidence than adults. This may be due to lack of immunity acquired during intrauterine life. Incubation period varies between 3-6 weeks. Clinical features:- Severe pruritus is the main symptom which worsens at night leading to excoriation and secondary infection. Burrow/serpentine line is pathognomonic sign of scabies. Burrows appear as greyish white thread like lines that can be easily removed revealing an erythematous base. They are seen on interdigital webs, sides of wrists, elbows, axillae, areolae, umbilicus, lower abdomen, genitalia, buttocks and thighs. Other lesions include papules, vesicles, nodules, pustules, excoriations, lichenification and rarely kerion-like patches. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings.

### Response:
 g. Regression analysis is used when there is need to predict values of one variate (dependent variable), on the basis of known values of another variate (dependent variable).
Hence, the correct answer is B (Coefficient of regression). (Ref : Park's Textbook of PSM 25th ed pg 845)
Regression Analysis

Regression analysis is concerned with finding relationship between two variables X & Y so that it may be possible to forecast the probable value of Y if corresponding value of X is known.

Types of Regression Analysis -

Simple Linear Regression - When one independent / predictor/ explanatory variable is present e.g., BMI vs SBP.
Multiple linear regression - When more than one independent/predictor/explanatory variable is involved e.g.., BMI + smoking habit vs SBp.
Logistic Regression - Used when dependent variable is qualitative rather than quantitative i.e., binary logistic regression (disease/no disease).

Uses of Regression Analyses


To find out whether there is significant association b/w 2 variables.
To determine strength of association b/t 2 continuous variables.
For prediction of future events based on past data.
In multiple regression analysis, coefficients indicate magnitude of change in outcome measure for unit increase in predictor variable while keeping all others constant.

D) Transferrin
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g C i.e., DMT1 (Ref: Robbins 8th/ p. 655-656; Harrison 18/e p. e-20)
Hence, the correct answer is C (Divalent metal ioon transpo). (But keep in mind that hepcidin inhibits ferroportin directly but it acts through DMT -1 indirectly).
Hepcidin is an acute phase reactant produced mainly in liver cells which regulates body's iron stores by controlling release of iron stored in macrophages & enterocytes into circulation. It binds to ferropoin on these two cell types & inhibit their function leading to retention of iron within them. This way, when there is sufficient iron in blood stream, excess iron absorbed from intestine is retained inside enterocyte instead of being transferred to plasma transferrin. When serum ferritin falls below certain level indicating depletion of storage iron, hepacidin levels fall allowing more iron to be released from both enterocytes & macrophage into bloodstream. Thus, regulation of hepacdin controls amount of dietary iron available for erythropoiesis.
Note : The direct action of hepidin is on ferropion while its indirect effect is mediated via DMT-1. So, if you"

Hence, the correct answer is D (Release of ADT and Pi). (Ref: Textbook of Medical Physiology - Guyton & Hall - Page No-58)
The crossbridge cycle can be divided into three phases:

Phase I: Formation of Crossbridges

In this phase, the heads of the myosins bind to active sites on the actin filaments.

Phase II: Power Stroke

This phase occurs when there is an interaction between the bound myosine heads and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), resulting in detachment of the heads from the actinin filament.

Phase III: Reattachment of Myosin Heads

During this final stage, the detached heads reattach themselves back onto the actinine filaments, ready to begin another round of contraction.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. The perinatal period begins at 28 completed weeks' gestation (or when fetal weight reaches 1,000 g). It ends seven completed days after bih. This definition includes deaths that occur before labor has staed, during delivery, and within one week after bihlh. In addition to stillbihs, it also includes early neonatal deaths (deaths occurring on day 0 through 6).
Hence, the correct answer is B (Early neonatal... grams). (Ref: Nelson's Textbook of Pediatrics 19th edition Pg no. 870)
://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/576111).
Explanation: Perinatol Moality Rate = Number of late fetal deaths + number of early neonata! deaths / total number of live births x 10000
Hence,
Perinatal mortality rate= Late fetal deaths+early neonatal death/total number of Live birthx10000

Late Fetal Death-Death of a fetus weighing more than 500grams or greater than 22weeks of gestational age
Early Neonatal Deaths -death occuring between first week of life

### Response:
 g Maxillary central & mandibular second molars have highest rate of agenesis (missing).
Hence, the correct answer is A (Maxillary Central Incisor). (Ref: Orthodontics: Diagnosis and Management of Malocclusion and Dentofacial Deformities; Shafers Textbook of ORTHODONTICS)
Most common permanent tooth to be affected by hypoplasia - maxillary central and lateral incisive
Most common deciduous tooth involved in trauma – upper central incisor
Most frequently fractured dental hard tissue element- enamel
Most resistant part of dentition to fracture- root
Least likely bone to get infected with odontogenic infection- zygoma
Hence most common tooth to miss out due to trauma is maxillary lateral because it has maximum surface area exposed compared to rest of the teeth.
Hence among all these factors, maxillary laterals will have more chances of being missed than others.

Also know:

The first molar is the largest tooth in human body.
Largest crown size of temporary tooth – First Molar
Smallest crown size – Third molar
Longest root length – third molar

### Response:
 g. Modified Bishop Score (MBS): It was designed by Neil L. Johnson in 1972 to predict success of induction of labour. MBS = Cervical dilation x 2+ Effacement %/10 + Station - 3 If total score >=6- Induction can proceed with oxytocin alone If <6- Prostaglandins should be used before proceeding with oxy tocics h. In above case, cervical length is 3cm i.e., 30%, so it's 3x2=6; station is -1, hence -3; Total score is 9 which falls under category d. Oxytocin induced labours have higher chances of cesarean section than prostaglandin E2 induced labors. This may be due to increased uterine activity leading to fetal distress. However, there is no difference between PGE2 and misoprostol when compared to oxytocines. Misoprostal has more side effects like diarrhea, nausea etc. Ref : Dutta book of obstetrics 7th Ed.

### Response:
 g. The Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN)
Hence, the correct answer is A (Open bite). (Ref: Textbook of orthodontics Gurkeerat Singh 2nd ed page no-3).
The index was developed by Brook in 1978 to assess treatment need based on aesthetic and functional aspects separately.
It has two components:

Functional component

Based on dental health component of DMF-T score.

Aesthetic component

Assessed using cephalometric tracing with visual analogue scale (VAS).

Overall assessment done by combining both scores into one number between 1–10.
Score <5 – No treatment needed
Score >7 – Definite treatment required
Score =6 – Uncertain whether treatment should be carried out or not.
Hence it can also be used for openbite cases but there will be high chances that patient may have uncertain result after treatment so we don’t recommend this case for treatment.
So, if you get such type of questions always remember that IOTNIOTN cannot be used in patients having skeletal class II/III malocclusions because they require surgical correction along with orthodontic therapy.

D) Greater auricular
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 greatest sensory supply to skin of face is by greater auricular nerve which arises from cervical plexus (c2 c3). It supplies sensation over postero-lateral aspect of neck & angle of mandible. During superficial parotids surgery it can be injured leading to loss of sensation in this area.
Hence, the correct answer is D (Greater auricular). (Ref: Textbook of ENT, Dhingra; 6th edition pg- 455)
The facial nerve runs through the substance of parotis gland but doesnot have any relation with its capsule so injury to facial nerve during parotoidectmy is rare.
Mandibular division of trigeminal has no role in supplying cutaneous innervation of face.
Auriculatemporal branch of CN V3 provides sensory innervations to posterior pa of auricle, external acoustic meatus, temporomandibula joint, TMJ disc, and skin of temporal region up to level of tragus. But it doesn't supply skin around angle of jaw.

### Response:
 g Refraction index (or refractive index)
Hence, the correct answer is A (Different refractive indexes of object). (Ref: Textbook of Microbiology & Immunology by Parija - Page No 8)
Phase contrast microscope was invented in 1936 by Dutch physicist Frits Zernike. It uses light waves to create an image of unstained cells that can be seen under a regular optical microscope. The phase contrast technique takes advantage of differences in how different types of material interact with light. In this case, it exploits the fact that transparent objects such as living cells have slightly different refractive properties than their surroundings. This difference causes some of the light passing through them to change its path, which results in loss of coherence between the wavefronts traveling along two paths. When these coherent beams meet at the objective lens they interfere destructively, resulting in dark areas around the cell boundaries. By adjusting the position of the condenser lenses relative to one another, the interference pattern may be made visible as bright rings surrounding the cell. These ring patterns allow biologists to see details within individual cells without staining them.
The basic components of a phase contrast system include:

1. Condensor diaphragm
2. Annular stop

### Response:
 g) The most common causative organisms in acute suppurative otitis media (ASOM) are streptococcii pneumonae, hemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. Among these three S.pneumoiae is the most frequent cause of ASOM in children upto 5 years age group.

Also know

The incidence of infection by different pathogens varies according to the age of patient : -

Hence, the correct answer is A (Pneumococus). Remember that among all ages, pneumococcus is the MC cause of Otitis Media but if we consider pediatric population separately then it's Hemophillus influenza which is the M.C. cause of Acute Supurative Otits Media in this age group.
Hence the correct answe is A(Pneumocucus). I am sure you will agree with me on this one.

### Response:
 g The DNA Polymerases

DNA polymerases I (pol I), II (pol II), III (pol III), IV (pol IV), V (pol V)
Pol I has three enzymatic activities:

(1) A 5’-to-3’ polymerization function,
(2) A proofreading 3’- to -5’ exonucleolytic function that can remove misincorporated bases during replication, and
(3) A separate 5 ‘→ 3 ’ exonucleytic function involved in recombination and repair.

Pol II also has two nuclease functions, but they have different specificities than those of pol I; it lacks the ability to synthesize DNA on its own.
Pol III holoenzyme contains α, β, γ, δ, ε subunits. The core enzyme consists of α,β,γ subunits with processive 5‘ → 3 ‘ synthesis capability. It requires accessory proteins such as θ, χ, τ, ρ.

### Response:
 g B i.e., Take drugs wth longer half life Drugs that have long t1/2 can be taken by breastfeeding mothers because they will remain at constant concentration in plasma & thus less likely to reach breastmilkQ.

### Response:
 giving the rate is tmax, giving the extent is AUC
Hence, the correct answer is B (Area under the cure). (Ref - KD Tripathi Pharmacology 7th edition page no 10)
The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), which represents total exposure to the drug over time, can be used to compare bioavailability between different formulations of the same drug. The peak plasma concentration (C max ) and the time at which it occurs (t max ), together with the duration of action, determine how quickly an effect will occur after administration and how long that effect will last. For example, if two drugs have similar efficacy but differ in their onset of action because they reach maximum concentrations at different times, then the one reaching its maximum more rapidly may be preferred by patients who need rapid relief of symptoms.
T1/2 =0.693×(time interval)

Note- Bioequivalence studies are performed using pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC and C max. These studies help ensure that generic versions of medications are equivalent to brand-name products in terms of safety and effectiveness.

### Response:
 g B i.e., Methylation Genomic Imprinting - The phenomenon in which one of two alleles at a paicular locus becomes silenced during gametogenesisQ (sperm or egg). This silencing occurs through methylation of cytosine residues within CpG islands that flank many imprinted genes. It has been proposed to explain why some diseases have an unequal incidence depending on whether they occur when the disease allele was inherited from mother or father. Eg: Prader-Willi syndrome & Angelman SyndromeQ
Hence, the correct answer is B (Methylation). (Ref: Robbins 8th/Chapter 1; Table 1-2)Genomic imprinting* Is a process whereby certain gene expression is determined by their parental origin.* A person inherits two copies of most genes, but with respect to some genes, it matters whether you got them from mom or dad.* These genes are said to be subject to genomic imprint ing.* For example, if both parents contribute equally to height, then we would expect children of two tall parents to grow taller than those whose parents were shoer.* But this isn't what happens. Children of two very tall fathers tend to be shorter than average, while children of very tall mothers tend to grow even more.*"

This technique is often employed when testing new drugs or treatments by comparing them to existing ones using double-blind randomized controlled trial methodology. For instance, if one were studying whether a new anti-inflammatory drug was effective in treating pain after surgery, then half of the test subjects would receive this new drug while the others received a dummy version of the same drug (a placebo).

### Response:
 g Enamel spindles (enamel projections)
Hence, the correct answer is A (Enamel spindle). (Ref : Textbook of oral biology by Suryakantha - page no- 71)
 
Explanation: The cells in contact with the developing enamel are called ameloblasts. They secrete organic matrix which gets mineralized to form enamel. Ameloblast originates from ectoderm at the cusp tip and extends towards cervical region along the surface of tooth germ. At first they lie close together but later become separated by secretion of enamel between them. As development proceeds, their outer ends move apically while inner end remain stationary. This results in formation of bell shaped cap over crown of tooth. When root begins to develop, these cells extend onto it also. Later on some of the ameloblastic cells may be left behind within the newly formed enamel forming so-called ghost cells. These cells disappear during eruption of teeth.

The process extending from the cell body into the enamel is known as Tomes' process. It has two parts:

1. Inner part – Rodlet

2. Outer part – Tubule

Tomes’ process disappears when enamel maturation starts. During this stage, rodlets break up into globules and tub"

### Response:
 guyton writes- ""The Nernst equation shows that when more than one ion species carries current through an excitable tissue, its membrane potential (Emf) is determined by the relative concentrations of these different ions on either side of the membrane. The Emf at rest in most cells is close to the K+ equilibrium potential because there are many more potassium channels open than sodium or calcium channels.""
Hence, the correct answer is C (No change). (Ref : Guyton physiology 12th edition pg 55)
Note - If we consider this question without considering the fact that RMP is near to EK, then it would have been hyper polarization.
But since RMP is near to Ek, so no change occurs.
Hence B is partially incorrect here.
If you don't believe me, read below -
""Because the normal value of E_K_ (-90 millivolts) is very close to zero, the membrane must be slightly negative to keep K+ inside the fiber; therefore, the actual value of the resting membrane voltage is between -60 and -70 millivoltes""
So, even though the equilibrium potential of k+ is -90mv, but due to high concentration gradient, the RMP becomes positive with respect to ek. So"

Options:
A) Single crown and bridge screw retained
B) Single crown and bridge cement retained
C) Overdenture
D) Hybrid denture
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Hybrid prosthesis is an overdenture supported by endosseous dental implant(s), which in turn support a conventional complete denture (hybrid = combination).
Hence, the correct answer is D (Hybrid denture). (Ref: Textbook of Prosthodontics - Sridhar Premkumar; Pg no- 210)
Overdentures can also be used but it has its own set of complications like fracture of abutment tooth etc.
Single crowns and bridges have limited use here because there will always remain some residual ridge left out to be covered up by denture base material.

Also know:

The hybrid denture concept was first described by Grunder et al. in 1998.
It combines features of both fixed partial dentures and removable prostheses.
In this type of prosthodontic rehabilitation, one or more natural teeth are prepared to serve as abutments for supporting a fixed partial den­ture that extends into the edentulous area where a traditional removable denture would normally rest on the mucosa.
This approach provides additional retention and stability to the fixed partial detniture through the presence of the natural teeth, while at the same time providing adequate oral hygiene access around these remaining teeth.

### Response:
 g) CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE ASSOCIATED DIARRHOEA (CDAD): It is caused by toxin producing strains of Clostridum difficle. The disease occurs after use of antibiotics such as clindamycin, ampicillin, cephalosporin, fluoroquinilone etc. which alter normal intestinal flora. Toxin produced by this organism causes damage to mucosal epithelium leading to fluid loss in stool. Treatment includes discontinuation of antibiotic therapy and administration of oral vancomycin or metronidazole. Vancomycin enema may be used if there is no improvement within 3 days. Ref : Ananthanarayan 9th edition page 356-357

### Response:
 g. Infrared Spectroscopy

Nitrous Oxide (N2O)

It has been used in dental procedures because it causes less tissue irritation than N2 and supports combustion.

The major disadvantage with its use is that it can diffuse into closed spaces such as middle ear and cause vertigo and nausea.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Infrared spectrometry). (Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th/e p1019)
 
Laminar flow helps reduce contamination by air-borne bacteria but does not help detect gas contaminants like N20.
Dosimeters measure radiation exposure over time; they do not have anything to do with detecting gases.
High-speed suction removes waste materials quickly but does nothing to remove trace amounts of toxic substances like N2O.
An infrared spectroscopic analyzer detects specific wavelengths of light absorbed by different molecules. It would be useful for identifying unknowns in an operating room environment.

 g C i.e., Suicidai tendancy increases as the patients improve Paradoxical suicide is seen in antidepressants like SSRIs (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). It occurs due to increased suicidal ideation & attempt during early pa of treatmentQ. This may be because these drugs act rapidly on mood but have no effect on thoughts & feelings immediately. So it can lead to an impulsive behavior which was previously suppressed by depression. The risk of this phenomenon is more common among children & adolescents than adults. - Antidepressant medications should never be prescribed without close monitoring especially in young people with severe depressive illness until they show clear signs of improvement. - If there is worsening of symptoms or emergence of new ones such as agitation, aggression, anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, restlessness, hypomania, mania, psychomotor hyperactivity, delirium, hallucinations, abnormal thinking or perception, euphoria, suicidal ideations or attempts, then stop the medication immediately and seek medical help urgently.

D) Lesser blood loss
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Midline perineal tear can extend into vagina on either side (lateral retraction). This does not occur with lateral episiotomies. The repair of tears extending laterally may require additional sutures than those required for median tears. However, this is not considered an advantage. Breakdowns do not occur more frequently after medial episiotomes but they tend to heal less well because of poor vascularity. Blood loss during delivery is similar whether it occurs spontaneously or by incision.
Hence, the correct answer is A (Less chance ofextension). (Ref: Textbook of Obstetrics D C Dutta 6th edition page no 375)
The text below has been added to explain why there was some confusion regarding the answer.

Midline Episiotomy

It extends downwards along the lower border of symphysis pubis towards the posterior fourchette. It heals rapidly without complications. But if it extends laterally then healing will take longer time and chances of infection increases.

### Response:
 g D i.e., Pediatric Consultation
Hence, the correct answer is D (Paediatric consultant). (Ref: Textbook of orthodontics Gurkeerat Singh 1st edition page no 6.)The eruption time varies in different individuals depending on their genetic makeup, nutrition status, health condition etc. The normal range of eruption times can vary by ±2 months. If there is delay beyond this period then it should be referred to pediatrician for further evaluation & management.
Hence children who have delayed eruption of primary dentition at age of 12 -15 months should be evaluated clinically and radiographically. A thorough medical history including family history must also be taken into consideration. In case of failure of eruption after completion of physiological root resorption of adjacent tooth, extraction may be considered.

### Response:
 g The minimum no. of lobed needed is 2 (mesial & distal).
Hence, the correct answer is B (2). (Ref : Textbook of orthodontics Gurkeerat Singh 2nd ed page-6)
 
Explanation: The dental lamina gives rise to buds which grow into teeth. These buds have an outer enamel organ covered by oral epithelium forming the clefts between them. Each bud has two parts:

Mesodermal part – Dental papilla
Ectodermal Part - Enamel Organ

These give rise to dentin and enamel respectively.

Each lobe of the enamel organ corresponds with one cusp on the crown surface. Thus, if there are more than three lobes in the enamel organs then it will result in extra cusps on the crowns of the developing teeth.
If there are less than three, they may be represented by grooves or fissures rather than actual cusps.
Thus, the minimum number of loci that must develop before a normal molar can erupt is four; these represent mesio-buccal, buccal, disto-buccals, and mesiodistal regions.

D) Increased urinary metabolites of cortisol
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g A i.e., Loss of Diurnal Variation - The most common cause of hypercortisolism in adults is exogenous administration of coicosteroidsQ (iatrogenic). It can be avoided by using lowest effective dose & stopping steroids when they are no longer needed. Other causes include pituitary adenoma causing excess secretion of ACTH (ACTH dependent), adrenal tumour secreting Coisol independent of ACTI- stimulation (ACTIIependent) & ectopic production of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) by nonpitutary neoplasm such as small cell carcinoma of lung. Clinical features of cushingoid state includes : Weight gain with centripetal obesity, moon facies, buffalo hump, purple striae on abdomen & proximal myopathy. These changes occur because glucocoicoids inhibit lipolysis, stimulate protein catabolism & increase deposition of fat around central areas of body. Hypertension occurs due to salt retention caused by mineralocorticoid action of excessive coisol. Osteoporosis results from inhibition of osteoblasts by high levels of circulating coisol which also inhibits calcium absorption.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g D i.e., Hydrolyzation of ATPQ to ADPP & PI - The myosin heads bind to active sites on F-actin (cross bridges). When an ATP molecule binds to the myosins it causes release of cross bridge from F-Actin. This results in relaxation of muscle fiber. So hydrolysis (breakdown) of ATP leads to detatchment of myosine head from Actin. - In skeletal muscles contraction occurs when calcium ions combine with Troponin C which triggers conformational changes that expose binding site on tropomyosin so that myosines can attach to actin filaments. - Sarcoplasmatic Reticulam stores large amount of Calcium ion inside its lumen. It releases these stored calcium ions during depolarization of motor end plate. These released calcium ions then trigger the above mentioned process.
Hence, the correct answer is D (Hydrolysis Of ATP To ADP And Pi). (-1). (Ref : Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology Twenty-Third Edition Page No-96)

### Response:
 g C i.e., 30 :2
Hence, the correct answer is C (30:1). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine - 18th edition / Page no- 2109)
The American Heart Association recommends that CPR be performed with at least two rescuers; however, if one rescuer must perform CPR alone, he should give 30 chest compress ions followed by two rescue breaths before repeating this sequence. The compression-to-rescue-breath ratio in children younger than eight years old is also 3 to 1, but the depth of chest compression is approximately 5 cm rather than 2 inches. In infants less than 12 months old, chest compress ion depth is approximately l inch, and the recommended rate is 100 to 120 per minute. For adults who have an advanced airway in place, such as endotracheal intubation, chest compression s can continue without interruption until spontaneous circulation returns. If there is no pulse after three minutes of uninterrupted chest compressio n, defibrillation should be attempted. Chest compressions may need to be interrupted briefly during defibrillatio n, which requires stopping chest compressi on for up to 7 seconds. After defibr illation, continuous chest compress"

### Response:
 g) Multiple Juvenile Papilloma (Recurrent Respiratory Papillomata)* Recurrent respiratory papillomas are benign epithelial tumors that arise within the aerodigestive tract.* They occur most commonly at the level of the glottis but can involve all areas of the airway* The disease has two peaks of incidence - one between ages 2-5 years and another after 20 years of age.* It may be associated with human papilloma virus types 6 &11.* Clinical features include hoarseness, stridor, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and feeding difficulties.* Treatment includes microlaryngeal surgery using CO2 laser, microdebrider, or excimer laser.* In severe cases tracheotomy may be required.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Microlarygoscopy). (Note : This patient doesnot require antibiotics because there is no infection present).
The treatment of choice for recurrent respiratory papillosis is surgical removal by microlarvngoscope under general anaesthesia. Laser ablation is used when tumour size permits.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 gycogenolysisis the process by which glycogenis broken down into glucose-1-phosphate (Glc-1-P),which can be conveed to free glucose in glycolysis.Glycogenolysi occurs mainly in liverand muscle cells.The rate at which this reaction proceeds depends on several factors including hormone levels such as epinephrine, glucagon, insulin, and cortisol; nutrient availability such as blood sugar level; and energy needs.Ref: Harper&;s Biochemistry; 30th edition; Chapter 18 The Pentose Phosphate Pathway & Other Pathways of Hexose Metabolism
Hence, the correct answer is D (Glycosenin). (Ref: Harper's Biochemistry 30/e p205 table 17-2)
The enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and breakdown have been studied extensively using various techniques. In addition to their catalytic functions, some of them also bind specific proteins that regulate activity. For example, glycogen synthetase has two forms, one active when phosphorylated and another inactive when dephosphorylated. This regulation allows the cell to control its own carbohydrate metabolism according to signals received from hormones and nutrients. Regulation of glycogen degradation involves similar mechanisms.

### Response:
 g B i.e., Amegkaryocvtic thrombocytopaenia Thrombocypenic purpura (TTP) - Characterized by microvascular bleeding & pancytopeniaQ; Petechiae, ecchymoses, epistaxis, GI bleed, hematuria etc. TTP is caused due to deficiency of vWF which results in platelets adhesion defectQ. It can be congenital or acquired form. Congenital form occurs d/t mutation in ADAMTS13 gene that encodes metalloprotease enzyme responsible for cleaving large multimers of VWF. This leads to accumulation of ultra-large VWF multimer resulting in platelet aggregation & formation of microthrombi. In contrast, acquired forms of TTP occur secondary to autoantibodies against ADAMST-13 leading to decreased levels of this proteolytic activity. The clinical features include fever, malaise, headache, myalgias, ahralgia, neurologic symptoms like confusion, seizures, coma, stroke, renal failure, retinal haemorrhage, DIC, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegy, leukoerythroblastosis, anemia, le"

The Liley's chart was developed to help predict fetal anemia in Rh isoimmunization based on MSAFP levels measured between 16 and 26 weeks' gestational age. It has been modified by Queenan & Oskai to include the use of mean corpuscular volume (MCV), but it remains controversial because of its limited accuracy when compared with direct measurement of hemoglobin F concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Fetal blood sampling can be performed transabdominally or transcervically. Transcervical cord puncture may have lower risks than transab-dominal procedures; however, this approach requires specialized training and equipment. Ultrasound guidance is essential for both approaches. Cordoscopy allows visualization of the umbilical vessels before needle insertion and reduces the risk of bleeding complications. Blood samples should be obtained under continuous ultrasound monitoring, and the procedure must be terminated immediately if there is evidence of fetal distress or significant maternal bleeding.

### Response:
 g Suturing is done in such a way that there should be at least three layers of sutures on either side of wound (i.e., total six layers). So, if we assume an average thickness of tissue layer to be one centimeter, then the required length of thread would be equal to twice the width of the incised area plus four times its depth i.e., 2 x + 4 x = 6 x.
Hence, the correct answer is C (6xincision length). (Ref: Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 26th edition, page no-7)
Hence the correct Answer is C ((6x incision length.). (Ref; Bailey & Loves Short Practice Of Surgery,26th ed,page no -7). If this was multiple choice type question with more than one option being correct, I would have gone for D(8x Incision Length),as it is always better to err on safer side when it comes to suturing wounds.

### Response:
 g Prognosis is related to lung hypoplasia & pulmonary vascular resistance (pulmonary hypeension).
Hence, the correct answer is A (Pulmonary hypertension). Explained in detail below :
Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia

CDH results when there is an abnormal opening between the chest cavity and abdominal cavity that allows organs such as intestines to move into the chest.

Most common site → Posterolateral defect along the medial border of the spleen (Bochdalek hernia)

Other sites - Anteromedial (Morgagni), through the esophageal hiatus (foramina of Morgagni).

The most commonly affected organ is liver followed by small intestine, colon, stomach, spleen, kidney, pancreas, bladder, ureter, ovaries/testis.

Pathophysiology -

In CDH, the lungs do not have enough room to develop properly because they are compressed by the abdominal contents entering the thoracic cavity. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation after birth due to decreased functional residual capacity (FRC) and increased work of breathing.

Prognosis depends on two factors :-

1) Degree of lung hypoplasis
2) Severity of pulmonary hypertension

### Response:
 g Complete debridgement & Apexification

Apexification:

It is a procedure to induce calcific closure of open apices of immature teeth with vital pulp.

Indications:

1. Root development incomplete (open apex)
2. Pulpal tissue inflamed but still vital
3. Patient has reached an age when he can cooperate for long-term follow-up.
Treatment plan:

The tooth should be restored by stainless steel crown immediately after completion of apexification.
Medication used for apexification:

Calcium hydroxide paste applied into the canal until it reaches the level of the cementodentinal junction.
This will allow calcium ions to diffuse through dentin toward the apex at which point they combine with phosphate ions present in water within the tissues surrounding the apex to form calcium phosphate crystals that fill the space between cells and promote healing.
After 6-12 weeks, the calcium hydroxine paste is removed using gentle irrigation with sterile saline solution followed by obturation of the canal with gutta-percha points coated with zinc oxide-eugenol cement.
Stainless steel crowns are placed on these teeth to protect them against occlusal forces and prevent fracture.
Root growth continues over time; however, this process may take several years.

C) Blue
D) Dark Brown
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g B i.e., Red
Hence, the correct answer is B (Red). (Ref: Textbook of Forensic Medicine & Toxicology; Krishnan Vij; 5th edition; Page no: 108)The area of necrosis in MI appears red because it has been reduced by dehydrogenases present in mitochondriaQ.Tissue samples can also be fixed in formalin before sectioning and staining with H&E stain. The dead cells appear eosinophilic (pink), while living cells have more blue cytoplasm.The most common method used to detect early changes after ischemia is the use of TTC (triphenyl tetrazolim chloride) which stains live tissue brick-red but does not penetrate into areas where there is cell death. This technique is useful when examining frozen sections of heart muscle obtained at postmortem examination. It may take up to several hours for this reaction to occur so that if the time interval between death and sampling is too long then the results may be inconclusive. In addition, some forms of injury such as hypothermia may cause an artefactual positive result. Other methods include using fluorescent dyes such as nitroblue tetrazolum (NBT) and ethidium homodimer-1 ("

Wires used in orthodontics can be classified into two broad categories:

1. Stainless Steel Wires
2. Non-stainless Steel Wire

Stainless Steel Wire

These are made up of Chromium-Nickel-Molybdenum alloys containing more than 10 percent of Cr and Ni. They may also contain molybdate which increases their corrosion resistance. These wires should conform to the specifications laid down by the American dental association (ADA), i.e., they should contain at least 52 percent of Fe, 18 percent ofCr,8percent ofNi,and 0.75 percent of Mo.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. The formula to calculate CI is p ± Z x √p(1-p)/n where p = proportion; n=sample size; z = standard normal variate corresponding to desired level of significance. For 95 % confidence limit, z value is 1.96. In this case, p =0.1, n =100, so CI would be 0.10±1.9√0.01/100 = 0-04 - 0·16 i.e., 6%-14%. This corresponds with answer choice b.
Hence, the correct answer is B (16-Apr). (Ref: Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 24th Ed Page No. 68)
#Park #Preventive_and_social_medicine #Statistics
Hence the correct Answer is B (#16-%). ( Ref : Park's textbook of preventive and social medicine 25 th edition page no 69 table 5.2 ).
Explanation: Confidence Interval Formula :
P +/- Z * sqrt(P*(1-P)/N)

Hence, the correct answer is A (Epiblast). (Ref: Human Embryology by I B Singh 8th/ p-30; Langman's Medical Embryolgy 11/e p54)
Hence the correct Answer is A ((Epiblaster). (Reff : Human Embryoogy by IB singh 7/e p29 ; Grays Anatomy 40/e p1019 ). Explanation: The extra-embroyonic mesenchyme arises from epistalst cells migrating into the region between the primitive ectoderm and endoderm. This migration occurs at the cranial pole of the embryo where the epiblst cells pass through the primitive node. These cells give rise to all extra-embroynoic structures except the placenta.

Options:
A) Immediately taper off valproate and sta lamotrigine
B) Switch to carbamazepine
C) Continue valproate and serial drug monitoring in blood
D) Add lamotrigine to valproate
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g C i.e., Continue valporate & Serial Drug Monitoring in Blood Valporate is teratogenic (fetal neural tube defects), but it is also effective against absence seizures which do not respond well to most antiepileptics except clonazepamQ. Lamotrigene can be added to control GTCS. However, there is no evidence that adding another medication will prevent fetal malformations associated with use of valporate during pregnancy. Therefore, continue valporate and monitor its level by doing serum levels at least once weekly until delivery. The patient should avoid alcohol consumption because it may increase plasma concentration of valerate. Carbamezapapne is contraindicated in first trimester due to risk of spina bifidai. Clomazopam is used primarily for status epilepticus and panic attacks; however, it does have some efficacy in controlling absences. Topiramete is contrained in women who are planning to become pregnant because topiramote causes cleft palate and oral fissures in animal studies.

### Response:
 g Iron oxide is used to prevent backflow in gutta-percha cones during obturation.

Ref: Sturdevant operative dentistry by John J. Nunn; 7th edn page no 310
Hence, the correct answer is C (Iron oxide). (Ref: Textbook of Endodontics - K Sreedhar 2nd Ed P-204)
Note: The term ""backfill"" refers to filling material that flows into the canal space between the walls of the root canal and the surface of the prepared wall when pressure is applied to the cone. To minimize this occurrence, it has been suggested that iron oxide be incorporated into the guttapercha cones. This will allow the operator to visualize the flow of the gutta percha through the cone onto the instrument being used to apply pressure on the cone.
The use of boric acid as an anti-flux agent was first described by Grossman et al. It acts as a wetting agent and prevents the seepage of excess cement past the coronal portion of the post.

### Response:
 g C i.e., Third Arch
Hence, the correct answer is C (Third arch). The palatoglos- sus muscle arises in the second branchial arch but innervated by cranial nerve XIIQ. It forms part of the anterior pa of the palate and runs obliquely downwards to be inserted into the side of tongue just behind the tip. Its action is elevation of the tongue & depression of soft palate. All intrinsic muscles of the soft palate develop from mesenchyme derived from third pharyngeal arch except tensor veli palati which develops from the second arch. Tensor tympani also develops from second arch while all other muscles of mastication develop from first arch.
Hence the correct Answer is C ((Third arch).

 g. The most common cause of pleural effusion in children is parapneumonic effusions (40-50%). Other causes include malignancy, tuberculosis, rheumatologic disease, trauma, congestive hea failure, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, pulmonary embolism, and Meigs' syndrome. Pleural effusions can be classified into three types based on their etiology: exudative, transudative and hemorrhagic. Exudates have higher levels of protein and lower glucose compared to serum. Transudates occur when fluid accumulates due to increased hydrostatic pressure or decreased oncotic pressure. Hemorrhagic pleuritis occurs with infections such as pneumonia, empyema, cancer, pancreatitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. It may also result from anticoagulation therapy, bleeding disorders, trauma and neoplasms. Chest X-rays show blunting of costophrenic angles and/or obliteration of basal air spaces. Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis allows safe removal of large amounts of fluid while minimizing complications.

 g. EONISM (Transvestism): It is seen in males who derive sexual gratification by wearing women's clothing. The condition may be associated with transsexualism. Transvestites usually have normal heterosexual intercourse but they also get sexual satisfaction by rubbing their genitals on females' bodies called frotteurism. This behaviour occurs mostly among young men. They often pick up strangers in crowded places such as railway stations, buses etc., to satisfy this desire. If punished, they become depressed and suicidal.

### Response:
 g. (Odds Ratio / Relative Risk)
Hence, the correct answer is C (Ods ratio/Relatve risk). (Ref : Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine; 24th edition - Page no. 68 & 69)
The odds ratio is used to measure the strength of an association in case control studies.
It can also be calculated in cohort studies if incidence rates have been determined for exposed and non-exposed groups.
In cross-sectional surveys it may give some indication of relative risk but this will usually overestimate the true value because those with the condition being studied tend to be more likely than others to seek medical care and therefore become part of the study sample.
If there is no difference in prevalence among different subgroups then the odds ratio approaches one and indicates that there is little evidence of an effect of exposure on disease occurrence.
An odds ratio greater than one suggests positive association i.e., higher probability of developing the disease when exposed to the suspected agent.
Conversely, an odds ratio less than one implies negative association i,e lower probability of disease development when exposed.
The magnitude of the odds ratios gives information regarding the strength offhe relationship between the variables under investigation.
For example, an odd s ratio of two means that individuals"

### Response:
 g. The patient is already in second trimester so amniotic fluid can be easily aspirated by performing an amniocenteses which will help us confirm whether fetus is affected or not. This procedure carries risk of miscarriage but it's less than 1%.Chromosomal analysis using FISH (Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization) technique can also be done on chorion biopsy sample obtained through CVS during first trimester. But since this woman presented late in pregnancy we have no choice but go ahead with amnioticesis.Cordocentisis involves taking blood samples directly from fetal umbilical vein under ultrasound guidance. It is usually performed between 17-20weeks of gestational age. It allows direct karyotyping, DNA studies, Hb electrophoresis etc. However, there is increased risk of cord hematoma formation and fetal bradycardia after this procedure.NIPT uses cell free fetal nucleic acids present in maternal plasma. These cfDNA fragments originate from placenta and circulate freely in mother's bloodstream. They contain Y chromosome specific sequences that allow detection of male fetuses even when they constitute <10% of total circulating cells. NIPT detects trisomy 21, 13 & "

### Response:
 





The child in this question has : -


Low sodium (Na+)
High potassium (K+) → Hypokalemia
Metabolic acidosis (low HCO3-)


All these features suggest that it may be due to mineralocorticoid deficiency.


Mineralocorticoids have maximum effect on kidney i.e., they cause retention of salt & water by increasing reabsorption of NaCl in DCT.

So, there will be hypovolemia which causes tachycardia, low BP, increased respiration rate, prolonged capillary refilling time etc.
But how can we confirm whether it's due to congenital adrenal Hyperplasia or not??
In CAH, both glucocorticoidal & Mineralocorticol secretion decreases but the increase in ACTH stimulates the synthesis of sex steroids like testosterone.
This results in virilization of female infant at birth.
Male infants do not present with virilisation because their testes already contain high levels of testosterone.

### Response:
  B. Characterized by sudden increase in urine volume with decrease in u­rine osmolarity dependent on circulating vaso-pressin levels
Explanation: Pressor escape is characterized by sudden increases in urine flow rate that occur when plasma arginine vasopres-sin (AVP) concentrations exceed approximately 2 pg/mL. This phenomenon was first described in dogs but has also been observed in humans. The pressor escape occurs at AVP con-centrations above which there appears to be an inability to maintain renal sodium excretion despite continued elevation of blood pressure. At these high AVP levels, glomerular filtration rates fall because of decreased renal perfusion due to vasoconstriction induced by AVP. In addition, tubuloglomerular feedback mechanisms may contribute to this reduction in GFR. As a result, urinary solute delivery falls, leading to increased water reabsorption and reduced urine output. Thus, the pressor effect of AVP is diminished at higher doses of hormone, resulting in lower blood pressures than would have occurred if no such adaptation had taken place.

Hence, the correct answer is A (ICDAD). (But keep in mind that transillumination helps to detect occlusal lesions).
Reference- Sturdevant’s art and science of operative dentistry. Mosby Elsevier. Page no 30
Explanation: The International Caries Classification and Management Guidelines Association has developed guidelines for diagnosis and management of dental caries using the International Carious Lesion Assessment and Diagnosis Criteria (ILCADS), which was published by the World Health Organization in 2013. 
The ILCADS criteria include five stages of lesion progression:

Stage C1 – Enamel demineralization visible on surface inspection

Stage C2 – White spot enamel opacities detected visually.

Stage D1 – Small cavitation into outer third of enamel

Stage D2 – Cavitations extending through most of enamel thickness but not involving dentine

Stage E – Dentinal involvement
Hence it can be used to measure prevalence of pit&fissures caries.

### Response:
 g B i.e., Deep cerebella nucleusEfferents arise from deep cerebelllar nucleiQ (dentate, emboliform, globose & fastigial). The axons leave these nuclei to form three pas of superior cerebellarpeduncle; middle pa is formed by brachium pontis which carries efferents to pons. From there they pass through medial longitudinal fasciculus to reach oculomotor complex in midbrain. Fastigioreticular tract passes directly to reticular formation. Dentatothalamic fibers end on ventral lateral thalamic nucleus that projects to premotor coex & somatosensory area II. Emboliform-globose projection ends mainly on SMA. Thus all connections are with motor areas except those ending on fastigio-oculomotor system.Q
Hence, the correct answer is B (Deep cerebellular nuclei). (-). (Ref: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology 23rd/e p. 162)
The output neurons of cerebel lum are located within its deep nuclei. These nuclei send their axons out of the white matter of cere bellum to various parts of brain stem and spinal cord. Axons from dentate nucleus go to red nucleus and"

C) Clean catch void
D) Urinary bag sample
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g
Hence, the correct answer is A (Suprapubic aspirate). (Ref : Nelson 18th / p 2562)
The suprapubic bladder aspiration has been considered to be the gold standard for diagnosis of UTI in infants less than three months of age because it provides uncontaminated specimens that can detect bacteriuria at levels below 10,000 colony forming units per milliliter. However, this procedure may cause pain and anxiety to infant and requires sedation. It should therefore be used sparingly when there is strong clinical suspicion of infection despite negative results on urinalysis and sterile cultures obtained by clean-catch methods.

Also know

In children older than one year of age with symptoms suggestive of cystitis, a midstream clean-catheterized specimen is usually sufficient for diagnostic purposes.
For patients who have pyelonephritis or those whose initial evaluation reveals bacteria >100,000 CFU/mL, treatment must begin immediately without waiting for laboratory confirmation of the isolate's antibiotic susceptibility pattern.
Culture and sensitivity testing is recommended after completion of therapy to guide future management if recurrent infections occur.
If no growth occurs within 48 hours of incubation, the urine specimen should be retested.

D) Transcription
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. The 5'-to-3' exonuclease activity is involved in proofreading during both DNA synthesis and RNA degradation (RNAse D). It removes nucleotides that have been incorrectly incorporated into an Okazaki fragment on lagging strand during DNA replication. This process occurs in 51 to 31 direction. In contrast, RNA editing involves removal of introns by endonucleases followed by ligation of exons together. This also occurs in a 51-to-31 direction but does not involve nuclease digestion of RNA. Instead it uses enzymes such as RNase H which cleaves ribonucleic acid linked with deoxyribonucleotide residues within heteroduplexes formed between DNA and RNA molecules. These activities do not require energy input since they simply remove mismatched bases without adding new ones. They can be considered as passive processes rather than active enzymatic reactions like those required for DNA polymerization. Finally, transcription proceeds in a template dependent manner along the DNA molecule using one of its strands as a guide for mRNA production. Since this reaction requires addition of monomers onto the growing chain at their 53 ends, it must proceed in a ""52"" to ""32"" direction. Similarly, translation begins at the AUG start"

### Response:
 giant-cell-tumor-of-bone.jpg
Hence, the correct answer is B (Giant cell tumor). (Ref: Nelson's 20th edition page 2385-86). The characteristic feature of GCT is presence of large number of osteoclast like giant cells in sheets alongwith mononuclear stromal cells which have pale staining cytoplams. These features can be seen clearly under electron microscopy. Under light microscope these appear as having abundant clear cytoplsm containing many lysosomes. This gives them an appearance similar to that of macrophages but they do not stain positive for CD68 antigen. They also contain Birbeck granules which are rod shaped structures with a central linear striation. In this case x-ray shows typical soap bubble appearance due to cyst formation within the tumour mass. It occurs most commonly at epiphysis of long bones especially around knee joint. Other common sites include distal radius, proximal humerus and sacrum. Treatment includes wide excision followed by curettage and bone grafting. Recurrence rate after treatment is high i.e., upto 50%. Chemotherapy may help reduce recurrence rates. Prognosis depends upon age less than 10 years has better prognosis.

### Response:
 g. (Metronidazol): (KDT 6th ed., p. 732)* METRONIDAZOLE - It acts by interfering with DNA synthesis* NYSTATIN - it inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis in fungi.* TETRACYCLINES - inhibit protein synthesis by binding to ribosomes* SULPHONAMIDES - interfere with folic acid metabolism
Hence, the correct answer is A (Metrontidazole). (katzung pharmacology; 12 edition page no- 761)
The mechanism of action of metronidizole is still controversial but appears to be related to its reduction-oxidation propey which allows it to damage bacterial DNA during redox cycling. The drug has been shown to cause strand breaks in both plasmids and chromosomal DNAs of E.coli and B.subtilis. This effect may result from free radical generation or direct alkylation of purines and pyrimidine bases. In addition, metronidozole can also act on protozoa such as Trichomonas vaginalis and Giardia lamblia by causing disruption of their membranes. (Lippincott's illustrated reviews for biochemistry).

### Response:
 g B i.e., Apoptosisis an active process in which cells die without inflammationQ; it occurs due to activation of caspases (cysteine protease). It can be induced either through mitochondrial pathway or death receptor mediated pathways. Death receptors belong to tumor necrosis factor family & their ligands activate apoptosis via these receptors. Intrinsic pathway involves release of cytochrome c into mitochondria followed by its binding with APAF-1 that activates caspase -9. Caspase cascade leads to cleavage of DNA repair enzyme poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), nuclear breakdown, chromatin condensation, cell shrinkage etc. Extrinsic pathway also results in formation of apoptosome complex involving FADD, procaspase -8/10, leading to caspse activation & subsequent events. Both pathways converge on executioner caspasse -3,6,7 resulting in characteristic morphological changes like blebbing, fragmentation, karyorrhexis, pyknosis, eosinophilia, phagocytosis etc. These features distinguish apoptosis from necrotic cell death where there will be loss of membrane integrity, leakage of cellular contents, inflammatory reaction, organelle swelling, myelin figures, acidophillic"

### Response:
 ganser syndrome
Hence, the correct answer is D (Nasopharyngael carcinoma). (Ref: Textbook of ENT, Dhingra; 6th edition pg- 455)
Human papillomavirus (HPVs), which include more than 100 related viruses, cause anogenital warts in humans. HPV types can be divided into two major categories based on their association with cancer risk. The first category includes ""high-risk"" HPVs that have been associated with cervical cancers and some head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. These high-risk HPVs belong to subgenus A (16,18,31,33,35,39,45,51,52,56,58) and B(53).
The second group consists of low-risk HPFs that do not lead to cancer but may produce benign lesions such as genital was and common was. Low-risk HPF's belong to several genera including alpha (1,2,3,4,5,6,10,11,12,13,14,15,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,32,34,37,38,40,41,42,43,44,54,55"

### Response:
 gans of spread include lymphatic vessels (most common), blood vessels, direct extension to adjacent structures, implantation at distant sites, and transcoelomic dissemination. The axillary lymph nodes are the first site of metastasis in more than 90% of cases; therefore, they must be evaluated by sentinel node biopsy or complete axillary dissection. Lymphovascular invasion has been shown to have prognostic significance. Metastases may also occur through hematogenous routes, including lung, liver, bone, brain, adrenal glands, ovaries, kidneys, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and pleura. Inflammatory carcinoma spreads along the dermal lymphatics with resultant edema that gives rise to peau-d-orange skin appearance. Ref : Schwaz's principle of surgery 9th edition volume 1 page no 789

### Response:
 g Spastic dipelgia is most common sequela of PVL.
Hence, the correct answer is A (Spastic diplagia). I am also attaching some important points regarding PVL.

Important facts

PVL occurs in preterm infants.
It involves white matter around lateral ventricles.
Most commonly it affects frontal lobes & corona radiata.
MRI shows hyperintensity on T2 weighted images.
Sequelae include spasticity, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, seizures etc.
Spastic dipeglia is most frequent manifestation.
Hypotonia may be seen initially which later progresses to hypertonicity.
Infants have normal head size at birth but develop microcephaly over time.
Hemiparesis is rare because both sides are involved equally.
Harrison writes - ""The most characteristic neurologic abnormality associated with PVL is bilateral spastic diplegs.""
Hence among the given options spastic diplea is the best choice.
Remember that spastic quadrupirgesia can occur too but less frequently than spastic dipegla.
So if you get an option like spastic paraplagia go ahead and mark it as your answer.

(b) The supine position may cause respiratory distress because it increases venous return to hea which causes increase in pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure resulting in edema formation. (c) Trendelemburg's position can lead to decreased cardiac output secondary to reduced venous returns; this will result in hypotension and tachycardia. (d) Prone position has been used successfully in patients who have severe ARDS but its use is limited to those cases where there is no evidence of upper airways obstruction such as stridor or wheeze. Its mechanism of action is unknown. However, prone positioning improves oxygenation through redistribution of perfusion within lung parenchyma and reduction of atelectasis.

### Response:
 guyanate cyclase

Sodium Nitro Pruside (SNP)

It is used in hypertensive crisis.

Mechanism of action:- It acts on both Vessels & Heart by releasing NO which activates guanyl cyclase leading to increase cGMP levels - Vasodilation occurs without affecting heart rate or contractility.
Metabolism:- SNP gets degraded into cyanide ion → This cyanide can be detoxified by Rhodanese enzyme present in liver.
Active Metabolites:- Sulfur containing compounds like Thiocyanates also get formed during metabolism of SNP.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Guanylate Cyclase). (Ref: Essentials of Medical Pharmacology K D Tripathi 7th edition page no- 567)

### Response:
 g C i.e., (Docosahexoenoic acid) (171 - Ghai 7th)* Human milk contains docosa hexaenoic acids that are essential for visual development* The most important long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid found in human milk is DHA (docosahaxeoic acid). It has been shown to be necessary for brain function and vision**. Breast fed infants have higher levels of DHA than formula-fed babies.* Arachidonic Acid (AA), an omega-6 FA, also occurs naturally in human colostrum and mature milk at concentrations ranging between 0.5% and 1%. AA is involved in cell membrane structure and function, and it serves as a precursor for prostaglandins and leukotrienes***. In addition, AA may play a role in infant neurological development because it can serve as a substrate for synthesis of retinal phospholipids***. Infants who were exclusively breastfed had significantly greater proportions of arachidonyl ethanolamine and lower ratios of dihomo-gamma-linolenoyl ethanolamide to arachidonoyl ethanolo amide compared with those who received formula feeding alone***.

D) 8.96
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g /dL = Mean - (Z x SD)
= 10-6 - (1.645 x 2)
= 8.92 – 3.37 
= 5.55
Hence, the correct answer is D (8.95). (Ref : Park's Textbook of PSM 25th Ed; Pg no: 610).
The value obtained above is approximate because we used Z score of 1.65 instead of exact value of 0.15.
Explanation :
In this example,
Mean = 10·6 mg/100 ml
SD = 2 mg/ 100 ml

So, Hb < 9·6mg/100ml would be two S.Ds below the mean.

Now, if you want to know how many women out of 100 would fall into that category, use normal distribution curve:

### Response:
 g C i.e., Lorazepan - Benzodiazepines (Lorazapam & Midazolam)Q are commonly used to induce anaesthesia. Opioids like fentanyl can also be used for this purpose. Intravenous anesthetic agents that have been widely used include thiopental, propofol, etomidate, ketamine, barbiturates, benzodiazephines, opioids etc. Propofol has become very popular because it does not cause histamine release which may lead to hypotension, bradycardia, bronchospasm, laryngospasm and wheezing. It causes pain on injection but premedication with lidocaine prevents this. Etomidate produces few cardiovascular side effects; however, it can produce adrenocoical suppression due to inhibition of enzyme 11b-hydroxylase. Ketamine increases heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output and oxygen consumption by stimulating sympathetic system. However, it decreases systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary compliance.

Zone of contamination

This area contains bacteria, necrotic tissue debris, inflammatory cells, and blood vessels.

Zone of infection

The next layer consists mainly of neutrophils that have migrated in to combat bacterial invasion. This zone also contains lymphocytes and plasma cells.

Zone of irritation

In this outermost region there are fibroblasts with collagen fibers, capillaries, and numerous mononuclear phagocytic cells (macropahges), which differentiate into large multinucleated giant cells called osteoclastic cells. These cells secrete enzymes such as acid phosphatase and lysozyme, which break down bone matrix components.

The most common cause of cervical root resorption is trauma to developing teeth in children and adolescents. The second most frequent etiology is orthodontic tooth movement with fixed appliances.

Root Resorption

It can be classified into three types:

1. Physiological resorption that occurs during shedding of primary teeth and eruption of permanent teeth.
2. Pathological resorption which may occur due to injury, infection, orthodontics treatment, periodontitis etc.
3. Developmental resorption such as seen in amelogenesis imperfecta, dentin dysplasia, odontodysostosis, cleidocranial dysostosis etc.

Pathologic Root Resorption 

This type of resorption usually involves the crown portion of the root but sometimes it extends along the entire length of the roots. It has been reported to have an incidence ranging between 0.5–6%.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g) The management of placental insufficiency includes delivery at term (38-40weeks). If there is fetal distress then earlier delivery should be done. In case of severe fetal growth restriction, it may be necessary to deliver before 32 weeks. This can lead to significant morbidity in preterm infants. Therefore, expectant management is recommended until 34-36 weeks when antenatal corticosteroids have been administered to enhance lung maturity. h) Antepaum Corticosteroid Therapy - It has become standard practice to administer two courses of antenatalcorticosteroids between 24 and 33 +6 weeks gestation to women who are at risk of delivering prematurely. These drugs accelerate fetal pulmonary maturation by increasing surfactant production and reducing the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome. They also reduce the incidence and severity of intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis. A course consists of betametasone 12 mg IM every 24 hrs x2 doses or dexamethosone 6mgIMevery 12hrsx4doses. i) Delivery planning prior to 34 weeks' gestation requires careful consideration regarding whether vaginal versus cesarean section would be safest for both mother and fetus."

### Response:
  C. Urethrovascular fistula 
Hence, the correct answer is C (Urethroveaginal fislura). (Ref: Textbook of Gynecology by DC Dutta -3rd edition, page no- 410).
Hence the correct Answer is C ((Urethrovesical fistula). (REF : TEXTBOOK OF OBSTETRICS SHEILA BALAKRISHNAN PAGE NO 412)
Note: In case of vesico-vaginal Fistulae, there will be staining all over the pad whereas in case of uretero-vaginai fistulaa, urine will pass into the vagina but due to high pressure, it may also cause hematuria which can give false positive result.
Vesicourethral fistulas occur more commonly than vesicovagina] fistulas because they involve less tissue destruction during separation of the bladder neck from the lower uterine segment.

### Response:
 g Enamel formation begins with deposition of minerals on organic matrix (enamel proteins).
Hence, the correct answer is A (Enamel matrix). (Ref.: Orthodontics: Diagnosis & Management of Malocclusion & Dentofacial Deformities by John M. Palomo page 6)
The process of mineralization occurs simultaneously throughout all parts of the tooth structure except root apex which gets calcified last.
Hence it is also known as ""Root Apex Syndrome"".
It has been explained that there will be no pulp space in primary teeth because they get completely filled up during their development.

Key Concept: 
Mineralization of enamel starts after completion of its formation i.e., when the ameloblasts have moved away from the surface of enamel rods.

### Response:
 g
Hence, the correct answer is C (Anemia of chroni...). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th edition, Page 845; Wintrobe's Clinical Hematology, 12th edition page 1203)
Hence the correct Answer is C ((Anemia of chronic disease.). (Ref:Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine,18th edition,Page 845 ;Wintrobes clinical hematology,12th ed,pge 1203).
Explanation: The patient in this question is suffering from Rheumatoid Ahritis which can cause anemia of Chronic Disease. In such cases there will be decreased total body iron but increased percentage of circulating iron bound to transferrin. This results in low serum iron levels with high Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC), normal Serum Ferritin level and Microcytic Hypochromic blood picture.

### Response:
 g D i.e. Cervixal tear Outlet Forcep Complications - The most common complications associated with instrumental delivery by vacuum extraction are those that occur during rotation (as compared to internal rotation which occurs prior to application). These include lacerations of cervix & vagina, extension of an existing episiotmy incision, vulvar hematomas, fetal scalp injuries, facial nerve injury, cephalohematoma, subgaleal hemorrhage, brachial plexus injury, fracture claviculae, skull fractures, postpaum hemorrhages due to uterine atony secondary to excessive blood loss into soft tissues, maternal exhaustion, infection, etc. In case of outlet forcep deliveries, there is less chance of cervical tears because head has already rotated and extended so it will be delivered through perineum. So among the above mentioned choices, least likely complication would be cervical tear.
Hence, the correct answer is D (Cervical Tear). (Ref: Textbook of Obstetrics By DC Dutta 6th edition page no- 371).

Harrison says ""The classification of mild MR has been changed in DSM IV TR to include an additional category called borderline intellectual functioning which includes individuals with an IQ between 70 & 84"".
Nelsons says ""In addition, there is now a new diagnostic code for borderline intellectual function that applies when IQ scores fall within one standard deviation below normal but above 2 SD below mean (i.e., 70-75)"".
So according to both Harrison & Nelson, borderline intellectual dysfunction means IQ = 70 - 74.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g B i.e., UGA Selenoproteins contain selenium in their active siteQ; Selenium is present at the amino terminal end of these proteins (except de-iodinase type II). The tRNA that carries it has an unusual base called pyrrolysyl-Q. It recognizes stop codons QUGA & UGA can be used to code for selyencystein by changing its reading frame with help of special elongation factor named eIFSecQ. This process requires two additional factors namely Sel A & Se I P.Q. These factors bring about substitution of serine residue by seleno cysteine during translation. So there are 61 possible codons instead of 64 because one of them is redundant - UGA codes both for opal stop signal & selenocycteineQ.
Hence, the correct answer is B (UGA). (Ref: Textbook of Biochemistry D M Vasudevan 6th edition page no. 30)

### Response:
 g B i.e., Homologus repairCRISP - Cas-9 gene editing technique uses RNA guided DNA cleavage by an enzyme called cas-9 nucleaseQ to introduce double strand breaks in target genes that can be repaired using either non-homologous (NHEJ) or homology directed recombination (HDR). The HDR pathway requires template of same sequence & thus allows precise correction of mutations at specific loci. This has been successfully applied to correct genetic diseases such as sickle cell anaemia, cystic fibrosis etc.

The most sensitive test for detecting acute pancreatitis is serum amylase level. The normal value is <200U/L. Amylase levels may rise within hours after onset of symptoms and peak at 2-3 days with return to baseline by 7-10days. Serum lipase activity also increases during acute attack of pancreatitis. Lipase remains significantly increased even when amylases have returned to normal values. Therefore it is more specific than amylse for diagnosing acute pancreatisis. A threefold increase above upper limit of normal (>300 U/L) suggests acute pancreatits. However, both amylasae and lipase may remain normal in up to 15% patients with mild disease.

### Response:
 g Ans. (c) Do NTS after 120 minRef: William's Obstetrics 23rd Ed; Page No- 455NST is performed every hour until it becomes reactive or fetal demise occurs.NST is used in high risk pregnancies like diabetes mellitus, hypertension etc.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Do NST after I hr). (Note - This is an example of type II FHS where we do repeated NSTs till they become reactive).
If there was no history of DM then this would have been a case of Type III FHS and BPP score will be taken instead of repeating NSTs.
Type I FHS - Repeat NST if Non Reactive
Type II FSH - Continue doing NSTs until they become Reactive
            If still Non-Reactive proceed to Biophysical Profile Score
Type III FSH- Perform Biot Physical Profile Score immediately
Remember that these types were described by Manning et al in 1985
Hence Type II Fetal Heart Rate Monitoring requires us to continue performing NSTs unless they become Reaective otherwise we move on to perform BPS.

D) Methylphenidate
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. The patient is showing features suggestive of Tourette's syndrome (abnormal movements like eye-blinking/grunt sound). Treatment includes dopamine antagonist drugs such as haloperidol/risperidone. Clonazepam can also be added if needed to reduce tics. Other treatment modalities include behavior therapy, psychotherapy, botulinum toxin injections into affected muscles etc. Antidepressants may help decrease anxiety/depression associated with this condition but do not treat the core tic disorder itself.
Hence, the correct answer is A (RisperidONE). (P. 1205; Kaplan & Sadock's Synopsis of Psychiatry: Behavioral Sciences/Clinical Psychiatry, 10th edition)
Excessive Blinking - Blepharospasm
Grunting Sound - Vocal Tic Disorder
Tourettes Syndrome : Characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics that occur almost daily for more than one year after age six years.

### Response:
 g C i.e., Increased sensitivity & increased specificity - Sensitivity is propoional to prevalence of diseaseQ; Specificity depends on test characteristics (not related to prevalence). So if two tests are used sequentially then both will be positive even with low prevalence but specificities remain same. Therefore there is increase in sensitivity without change in specificity.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Increased sensitivity and increasing specificity). (Ref: Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 19th Edition, Page No- 71)

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. The hematocrit level should be monitored in patients who have denguele hemorrhagic shock because it reflects plasma volume depletion more accurately than hemoglobin levels do. Dengue virus infection can cause severe bleeding due to thrombocytopathy (decreased platelets), coagulopathy (disorder of blood clotting), and vascular damage. Patients may present with petechiae, ecchymoses, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, gastrointestinal tract bleeding, hematuria, melena, hematemesis, intracranial bleed, or death. Laboratory findings include decreased fibrinogen concentration, prolonged prothrombin time, increased partial thromboplastin time, low serum albumin, elevated liver enzymes, leukopenia, lymphadenopathy, and hemoconcentration. Treatment includes fluid replacement, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, administration of fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, packed red cells, and platelets if necessary.

### Response:
 g The cyclins that regulate G1 to S transition include D-type (cyclin D), E-type (cyclin E), A-type (cycilin A). The event of early acquisiton of malignant phenotypes in epithelial cells occurs at G1 phase of cell cycle. This is regulated by cyclin D.

Ref : Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, South Asia Edition, page-15
Hence, the correct answer is D (Cyclin d). (Ref: Robbins Pathology 8th/Chapter 2 - Cell Injury & Adaptation; Table 2-3.).. In this table you can see all types of cyclins with their functions. So according to it cyclin-D regulates progression through G1 into S-phase. Thus its overexpression will lead to uncontrolled proliferation i.e., cancer.

### Response:
 glossitis refers to inflammation of tongue sub mucous fibroses refer to scarring in oral cavity which can be seen with heavy tobacco use it has malignant potential (refer pgno:365 bdc vol3)
Hence, the correct answer is B (Submucuous fibrosis). Explanation: Glossitis refers simply to an inflammatory condition of the tongue. It may occur on one side or both sides of the midline. The most common cause of chronic glossitis is iron deficiency anaemia. Other causes include vitamin deficiencies such as folate or vitamin B12 deficiency, pernicious anaemia, hypothyroidism, lichen planus, syphilis, tuberculosis, leprosy, candidiasis, trauma, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, graft-versus-host disease, Sjogren's syndrome, pemphigoid, Behcet's disease, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In some cases no underlying cause can be found. Oral lichen plants is characterised by white lines that run across the surface of the mouth. These lesions do not usually affect function but they can bleed easily if scraped. They have been associated with an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 810

### Response:
 ganser syndrome (also known as pseudodementia, hysterical dementia, or folie à double) is a condition in which patients give approximate answers to questions that they do not know the answer to. It can be seen after head trauma, abuse, or even physical illness. The patient may also feign memory loss, hallucinations, seizures, blindness, deafness, paralysis, etc. Ganser's syndrome is considered an example of dissociative disorder. Patients often have a history of being abused or mistreated. They usually present with clouding of consciousness, visual disturbances, amnesia, auditory hallucinations and confabulation. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities except when asked specific questions. When questioned, the person will respond with approximate numbers such as ""5"" instead of ""3"", ""10"" instead if ""7"". This phenomenon is called ""the approximation sign."" In some cases, the patient may repeat back exactly what the examiner said (""echolalia""). Treatment includes psychotherapy and treatment of underlying issues. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2478

### Response:
 g A
Hence, the correct answer is A (III). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 18th edition pg 1458-1460 table 240-1.)The mean electrical axis of the heart can be calculated by averaging the values in leads II, III, and AVF. The normal range is between -30° to +100°. An axis greater than +90° indicates right ventricular hyperophy; an axis less than -30o suggests left ventricular hypertrophy. If the QRS complex has a predominantly positive deflection in lead V6, then it is likely that the major vector lies superiorly and to the left. Conversely, if the Q RS complex has mostly negative deflections in leads V5 and V6, then the main vector probably points inferiorly and slightly toward the left side of the chest. Lead I will have a large positive deflec­tion when the main depolarization vector crosses this lead from right to left, and a small positive def­lection when the vector moves from left to right. Similarly, lead aVR will show a large negative deflec­tion when the principal vector passes through its area of recording, but little change when the vec­tor does not pass through this region."

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Oxygen therapy should be instituted in all preterm infants who have tachypnea (>60/min), apnoea, cyanosis, grunting, chest wall retractions, nasal flaring, or feeding difficulties. The goal of supplemental O2 administration is to maintain Pa02 between 50-65 mm Hg. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may also be used to improve lung compliance and reduce work of breathing. It has been shown that surfactant replacement improves survival rates among premature neonates with RDS when administered within the first few hours after birth. However, it does not prevent the development of BPD. Ventilation can cause barotrauma leading to pulmonary interstitial emphysema, pneumothorax, bronchopleural fistulae, and intracranial hemorrhage. Therefore, mechanical ventilation must be avoided whenever possible. In this case since the baby is having mild symptoms we will go ahead with warm humidified oxygen.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Warm oxygen). Explained above.

### Response:
 g. (See text)
Hence, the correct answer is C (15-20%). (Ref: Nelson's Textbook of Pediatrics 17th edition Page 1087).Mother-to-child transmission can occur before birth, during labor and delivery, and after birth through breastfeeding.Most perinatal infections result from intrapartum exposure.The risk of vertical transmission ranges between 14% -35%.The highest rates of infection have been reported when maternal viral load was >100,000 copies/mL at the time of delivery.Antiretroviral therapy significantly reduces the rate of transmission.In general, antepartum treatment with zidovudine decreases the likelihood of transmission by approximately one third compared with no prophylaxis.Prenatally exposed infants should be treated with zalcitabine, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine or zidovidine beginning within 6 hours of life and continued until age 1 year.Breastfeeding increases the chance of postnatal transmission up to an additional 12%-16%.

 ganser syndrome (GANS), also known as pseudodementia, is an organic brain disorder that can be caused by many different factors including head trauma, encephalitis, toxic states such as carbon monoxide poisoning, metabolic disorders, degenerative diseases of the central nervous system, paial complex seizures, hypoglycemia, alcohol withdrawal, intracranial tumors, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and even prolonged sensory deprivation. The symptoms include confabulation, delusions, hallucinations, amnesia, and catatonia. It has been described in children as well.[citation needed] Ganser's syndrome is characterized by approximate answers to questions asked during interrogation, which may lead to false confessions. This condition is sometimes referred to as ""prison psychosis"" because it occurs most often among prisoners who have been subjected to physical abuse while incarcerated. In some cases, patients will give exact numbers when they do not know them; this phenomenon is called the ""give away sign"".[vague][unreliable medical source?]

Scaphoid Fracture Treatment Guidelines
Fractures of the scaphol should always be treated conservatively unless there is clear evidence that they have been displaced by more than 1 mm on X-ray. If such displacements occur then reduction must be achieved before immobilisation in plaster cast. Displaced fractures which cannot be reduced accurately enough to allow satisfactory healing in plaster should be fixed surgically using K-wires or screws. Non-displaced fractures without significant comminution do not need fixation; however, if the patient"

D) Miotic
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. Atropine is used in organophosphate poisoning to counteract muscarinic symptoms (miosis, bronchospasm etc). It has no effect on peripheral cholinesterase activity but antagonizes all effects of acetylcholine by blocking its action on end organs. The dose required is usually 2-6 mg i.v. repeated every 10 min until secretions cease; total doses up to 100mg may be needed. In severe cases, it should be administered continuously by an infusion pump. If necessary, neostigmine can he added to reverse paralysis caused by excessive use of atropeine. At present, oximes such as pralidoxime have replaced atropiee in most cases of anticholinesterases poisoning because they act more rapidly and effectively than atropinereflex tachycardia and mydriasis occur within minutes after injection whereas drying of secretions takes longer. However, some clinicians still prefer to give atropinee first followed by oximes if there is no improvement. Ref - Krishan vij medicne& health 3rd edition page no 101

### Response:
 g/24 hours
Hence, the correct answer is A (Urinary concentration...). (Ref: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology; 23rd edition; Pg no: 661)
Hence the correct Answer is A ((Urinary...). (Ganong's review of medical physiology; 22nd ed; pg-660).
Note: The value of P should be expressed in same units as that of U i.e., if U is measured in grams/day then P must also be measured in gram/cm H2O. If it is measured milligrams /day, then P will have to be measured milligram cm H2 O. This can be achieved by multiplying urine osmolality with solubility coefficient of substance being filtered. For example, when calculating creatinine clearance we multiply urinary creatinine excretion with water solubilty coefficient of creatinine which is 0.8. So, P=Ux0.80. Similarly, when measuring urea clearnce, we use water solubiity coefficient of urea which is approximately equal to one. Therefore, P = Ux1.

Explanation: Ans- C Ref - Williams Obstetrics 24th ed pg 795 The patient in this question has developed postpartum hemorrhage due to retention of part of the placenta which was confirmed on ultrasound scan done at that time. This history points towards diagnosis of placental abruption. In case of placenatia accreta there will be no blood clots but rather a mass attached to myometrium. It can also present with features similar to those seen in abruption like pain and bleeding. But it doesnot have characteristic feature of uterine tenderness. Also know : Types of placents based on their shape Normal (Type I) Bifid (type II) Circumvallate (type III)
Hence, the correct answer is C (Placenta acerta). (Ref: William's obstetrics 23rd edition page 791; Dutta book of obstetrics,7th edition, chapter 5.). Table 1.

### Response:
 g Relative position of oblique ridges

The relative positions of the distobuccal (DL), mesiolingual (ML) grooves in relation to the occlusoaxial length of root have been found most consistent and reliable criteria for differentiating between first, second and third molar roots.

Ref : Textbook of endodontics Nisha Garg 5th ed page no 55
Hence, the correct answer is B (Relative position on ML groove). (- Ref:Text book of Endodontology by Nisha gaur pg.no-56).
Most common variation in number of roots seen with mandibular 3 rd molar followed by maxillary & then mandibuler 2 nd molar.
Mandibular premolars usually has two canals but may occasionally be three or four; Maxillary premolars almost always have one canal except when they have two.
Hence it is impoant to know that there is high probability of having more than one canal in all teeth except upper central incisor which mostly has one canal.

### Response:
 gynecological causes of recurrent pregnancy loss include uterine anomalies, leiomyomas, endometriosis, Asherman syndrome, cervical incompetence, polyps, congenital malformations such as septate uterus, bicornuate uterus, unicomunate uterus, transverse vaginal septum, double vagina, adenomyosis, hermaphroditism, synechiae formation in the cavity due to previous surgery, submucous myoma, intrauterine adhesions (Asherman's syndrome), and Mullerian agenesis. The most common cause of first-trimester miscarriage is an abnormal karyotype in either parent. Chromosome analysis should be performed on both parents if there have been three consecutive spontaneous abortions. If there has been one prior abortion, chromosome studies may be considered if the woman is over age 35 years at conception. In cases where no specific etiology can be found after evaluation, it is reasonable to perform genetic testing on products of conception obtained by curettage. This test detects balanced translocations that would otherwise go undetected. Transvaginal sonography (TVS) is useful in identifying structural defects within the uterus.

### Response:
 g Ti-6AI-4V alloy has two phases α (hexagonal close packed structure) & β (body centred cubic).
Hence, the correct answer is C (Ti). (Ref : Ananthanarayan 9th ed pg 661)
 
Explanation :
The composition of titanium alloys can be divided into four categories based on their microstructure:

Alpha alloys contain more than 85% alpha phase at room temperature. These include pure titanium grades up to grade 5 which contains 5 wt.% aluminium and 3.55–4.50 wt.% vanadium.

Beta alloys have less than 10% alpha-phase at room temp. The most common beta-rich alloy is Beta-Calcium (also known as Ti-15Mo-2.5Fe).

Near-alpha alloys contain between 80% and 90% alpha at room temperatures. They typically consist of an alpha-matrix with intermetallic precipitates such as Ti2AlNb, TiAlCrV, or TiAlCuV. Near-beta alloys contain around 95% beta at room temps. This group includes Ti-12Mo-6Zr-2W and Ti-5Al-5V-5Mo-3Cr

### Response:
 g. The instrument shown is elevator which is used to separate roots of multirooted teeth during extraction.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Slow separation). (Ref : Textbook of oral medicine and pathology - Sreekumari ed2 pg 310)
 
Explanation: 
Elevators are instruments with broad flat blades that can be placed between two adjacent tooth surfaces. They may have one end rounded and the other pointed; they also come in different sizes depending upon their width. Elevator is used when there is insufficient space to place an extractor blade between the teeth. It is especially useful if it is necessary to elevate the crown off the root before attempting removal by direct traction.

### Response:
 g A i.e., Posterior Cruciate Ligament Pivot Shift Test - It is used to detect ACL tearsQ. The patient lies supine with his/her hip flexed at 90deg & foot externally rotated so that lateral aspect of leg rests on examiner's thigh just above patella (pivot shift position). With valgus force applied to proximal tibia by examiner's hand, the tibia subluxates anteriorly while femur rotates laterally. If there is an ACL tear, this movement occurs easily but when the weight is transferred onto the lower limb, the femoral condyle reduces back into place with a distinct ""clunk"" known as positive pivot shift signQ. This indicates complete rupture of ACL. In partial injuries, it may be negative or incomplete clunk will occur.
Hence, the correct answer is A (Posterior cruciatae ligament). (.).. Pivot shift test is done for ACL injury. But if you read the description closely, you'll see that posterior drawer test is also described which is done to assess PCL integrity. So, both tests can be asked together.

It presents with fever, lethargy, poor feeding, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, rash, vesicular lesion on extremities & respiratory tract. CNS involvement occur due to direct extension of infection into brain parenchyma. The most common presentation is seizures followed by lethargic state, irritability, bulging fontanelle, apnea, temperature instability, poor suck & feedings. Ocular involvement usually results from maternal transmission across the genital tract. Presents as conjunctivits which progresses rapidly to keratitis, scleritis, iridocyclitis, choroidoretinitis, cataract formation & glaucoma.

The text below has been added to explain in more detail why this is so.
Explanation:* HEPARIN is an endogenous polysaccharide that binds with high affinity to AT-III.* It potentiates the activity of AT-1111 by increasing its rate of association with thrombin and Factor Xa.* This results in increased inhibition of these two enzymes and thus decreased generation of thrombin.* In addition, heparin can bind directly to thrombin, thereby blocking its interaction with fibrinogen and platelets.* Heparan sulfate proteoglycans on endothelial cells also interact with AT-11I and enhance its ability to regulate thrombin levels"

### Response:
 g The clinical scenario described above suggests Burkitt's Lymphoma (BL). BL is an aggressive tumor of mature B cells that arises at sites rich in neoplastic cells such as bone marrow, ileocecal region, mandible, maxilla, ovaries, kidneys, adrenals, etc. It has characteristic histologic features including sheets of intermediate-sized lymphoid cells with round nuclei containing multiple small nucleoli (""starry-sky"" pattern), numerous mitotic figures, apoptotic bodies, and macrophages interspersed throughout the infiltrate. Immunophenotypically, these tumors express surface IgM, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a, and BCL6; they do not coexpress TdT. Molecularly, most cases have translocations involving c-MYC on chromosome 8p12-p14. These translocations result in overexpression of MYC protein, which drives proliferation of immature B-cells. In addition to its role in tumorigenesis, MYC also regulates cell growth during normal development. Ref: Wyatt C., Butterwoh IV J.F., Moos P.J., Mackey D.C., Brown T.G. (2011). Chapter 15.

### Response:
 ganser syndrome (also known as Ganser's syndrome, pseudodementia, hysterical dementia, or prison psychosis) is a dissociative disorder that was first described by Sigbert Gansser in 1898. It has been used to describe patients who have symptoms similar to schizophrenia but without hallucinations or delusions; it may also be seen with severe head injury, hypoxia, encephalitis, intracranial tumors, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, alcohol abuse, drug intoxication, malnutrition, and chronic fatigue syndrome. The main feature of this condition is clouding of consciousness which can lead to confabulation. Confabulations are false memories that occur when there is damage to the brain. They are often confused with lies because they seem so real. However, unlike lying, people do not intend to deceive others. People suffering from ganser syndromes will sometimes give answers such as ""I don't know"" even if they actually do know the answer. This behavior is called vorbeireden (""speaking past"") and is thought to be due to feelings of shame or fear. Other features include visual disturbances, amnesia, depression, anxiety, and psychomotor agitation. Treatment includes psychotherapy and medication Ref Harrison20"

### Response:
 ganser syndrome is an organic confusional state that can be seen after head trauma, infection (meningitis), drug intoxication, alcohol withdrawal, hypoxia, metabolic derangements, intracranial neoplasms, encephalopathy, and seizures. It has been repoed to occur with all of these conditions except for subarachnoid hemorrhage. The diagnosis of ganser's syndrome requires at least two of the three main criteria: visual hallucinations, approximate answers, and clouding of consciousness. Visual hallucinations may include seeing animals such as dogs, cats, snakes, spiders, rats, mice, birds, and insects; however, they do not have to be frightening. Approximate answers refer to giving nonsensical numbers when asked simple arithmetic questions. For example, if you ask someone how many legs a dog has, he might answer ""seven"" instead of four. Clouding of con- sciousness refers to decreased awareness of one's surroundings. Patients often appear drowsy but will wake up quickly upon being called by name. They also tend to sleep more than usual during the day. Ganser patients usually deny having any problems and seem unconcerned about their symptoms. In fact, some people"

### Response:
 g A i.e., Opinion of Doctor in Cou First-hand Knowledge is obtained by personal observationQ (eg - opinion of medical practitioner who has examined the body). Second-Hand Knowledge is derived from others (eg common witnesses).
Hence, the correct answer is A (Opinion of a docotr in cou). (Ref : Textbook of Forensic Medicine & Toxicology; Krishnan Vij page no 8)
The term first-hand means that it comes directly from one's own experience or perception rather than through an intermediate source. In forensic medicine, this type of evidence can be seen with regard to opinions provided by doctors who have personally observed injuries on victims' bodies during autopsy examination. The same applies to eyewitness accounts where individuals describe what they saw firsthand at crime scenes. This information provides valuable insight into events surrounding crimes because these observers were present when incidents occurred.
In contrast, secondhand knowledge involves learning facts indirectly from someone else instead of experiencing them oneself. For example, if you read news articles about a local robbery but did not see anything yourself, then your understanding would fall under secondhand information since you didn't observe the event firsthand. Similarly, hearing rumors spread among friends also constitutes secondhand data because those spreading gossip haven't experienced things themselves either.

 g C i.e., (Epinephrinie.5ml of l :lOOOIM)
Anaphylaxis - Anaphylactoid reactions may be treated with epinephrme administered by subcutaneous injection at doses ranging from 0.2 to 0-8mg every few minutes until symptoms improve. If no improvement occurs after three injections, IV administration should be considered. The drug can also be used topically if there has been local exposure to allergen such as insect bites or stings. In severe cases, adrenaline must be continued orally using inhalers or tablets while awaiting full recovery. Antihistamines have some effect but do not reverse airway obstruction; they are useful when adre naline does not help. Steroids reduce late phase responses and prevent recurrence on subsequent challenge. Methylprednisolone 125 mg daily for several days is recommended. Hydrocortisone 200-300 mg four times daily is equally effective. Leukotriene antagonists may be added to steroids in patients who experience recurrent attacks.

### Response:
 g Medium-pull headgear (MPHG), which has been used to treat patients with Class II skeletal relationships since its introduction in the early 1960s by Proffit. The MPFH was designed to be more efficient than traditional high-pull designs because it uses less force on the teeth and thus produces fewer side effects such as root resorption.

Ref: Orthodontics: Diagnosis and Management of Malocclusion and Dentofacial Deformities 3rd edition page 1016
Hence, the correct answer is B (Medium pull headgear). (-2). (medium -pull head-gear is most effective in correcting vertical maxillary excess).
High Pull Head Gear

It consists of an elastic strap attached to a metal frame that fits over the crown of the upper molars and extends up behind the patient’s ears to two clips that attach to the back of the headband of the glasses. It pulls backward and upward on the maxilla, thereby reducing the length of the face and increasing the facial height.

In order to create such an environment, it would seem logical to condition the tooth surface prior to placing the MTA mixture on the area. This could include removing the smear layer created by instrumentation during preparation of the site, removal of bacteria, and application of growth factors or medications known to enhance tissue repair.

Question: During exercise, the most rapid way to synthesize ATP is:
Options:
A) Glycogenolysis
B) Glycolysis
C) TCA cycle
D) Creatine phosphate
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Creatine Phosphate

The immediate source of energy in muscle contraction is creatinine phosphate (phosphocreatine).
It provides energy by phosphorylating ADP to form ATP.

Glycogen stored in liver & muscles can be broken down into glucose which enters glycolytic pathway to produce ATP.
TCA Cycle produces NADH + FADH2 that enter electron transport chain to generate ATPs.
Hence, the correct answer is D (Creatine phosphate). (Ref: Textbook of Biochemistry Dr. Satyanarayana 5th Ed Page No- 101)
Note: The order of utilization of sources of energy during intense muscular activity is:

1.     Creatine phosphatase → Glycolytic Pathway → TCA Cycle
2.     Order of production of ATPs during rest - TCA > Glycolyic Pathway > Creatine Phospate
3.     In Liver also same sequence holds good except that there is no creatine phosphate present in liver.

 g. Endometrial implants have high level of estradiol which is responsible for their growth.
Hence, the correct answer is A (High estrogen). (Dr. Narayana Reddy - Gynaecology - Page no. 310)
Endometriosis

It refers to presence of ectopic endometrium outside the uterine cavity.

Etiopathogenesis:

Theories proposed include:

1. Coelomic metaplasia theory
2. Retrograde menstruation theory
3. Metastasis from an occult focus within the body
4. Lymphatic spread
5. Hematogenous spread
6. Embryonic rests
7. Molecular mimicry

Retrograde menstration is most widely accepted theory.
In this retrogradely flowing menstrual blood containing products of secretory phase carries with it endometrial cells that implant on pelvic peritoneum and grow into nodules.
This process may be enhanced by anatomical abnormalities such as bicornuate uterus, septate uterus, hematosalpinx etc.
Presence of endometrioisis in distant sites like lung, brain, kidney suggests hematogenous dissemination also plays role in pathogenesis.

C) Tramadol
D) Fentanyl
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Ans. (a) PentazoicinRef.: KDT 6th ed./ 455* This is a case of post-renal obstruction due to stone causing severe colicky pain.* Opioids can be used but they should have low affinity towards mu receptor because high doses may cause urinary retention leading to further increase in IOT and worsening of symptoms.* Therefore opioids having partial agonistic action on mu receptor like pentazoicins are preferred over pure agonists like morphine.* Other drugs that act similarly include nalbuphene and dezocine.
Hence, the correct answer is A (Pentazocaine). (kappa agonism + mu antagonism causes dysphoria & analgesia respectively; it also increases urine output by reducing ureteral spasm caused by opiate induced contraction of smooth muscles)
The most common side effect associated with buprenophine use is constipation. It does not produce respiratory depression when compared to full mu-opioid agonists such as fentanyl, oxycodone, methadone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, codeine, and morphine.

The most common cause of death due to rabie is encephalitis which occurs after incubation period of 2-10 days. The first sign of encephalis is fever followed by headache, agitation, confusion, aggression, disorientation, insomnia, anxiety, hyperactivity, hallucinations, seizures, paralysis, coma etc. Death usually occur within few hours or day after onset of symptoms.
Diagnosis of Rabies:

Clinical signs & symptoms
Histopathological examination of brain biopsy showing characteristic eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions called Negri Bodies.
Detection of rabvirus antigen in saliva, tears, CSF, skin biopsies using direct fluorescent antibody testing.

Treatment of Rabie

### Response:
 g
Hence, the correct answer is A (7.3 gm). Lactose content in breast milk is 7-9 gms per day. The average value being 7% i.e., 70 kcal/100 Kcal energy intake. It provides 20% of total calories at birth which increases to 40% by 1 year age. Human milk contains all sugars except sucrose. Carbohydrates are present mainly as disaccharides like lactose with small amounts of monosaccharide glucose & galactose. Breast milk also contain oligo saccharides that act as prebiotics promoting growth of beneficial bacteria in colon.
Lactose helps in maintaining osmolarity of milk. It acts as an anti-diarrhoeal agent because it inhibits bacterial adhesion to intestinal mucosa. It has been found to be protective against necrotizing enterocolitis.

Class II elastics have been used to retract molars distally with an angle of 30°–45° relative to the vertical axis of the mandible; Class III elastics can be placed at angles ranging between 25° and 50° relative to the maxillary arch form.
The direction of placement of these elastics should always follow the rule that they must pull against resistance rather than simply pulling on teeth. The use of headgear has also become more common in recent years because it allows for greater control over tooth movement while minimizing unwanted side effects such as changes in facial profile.

### Response:
 g-1
Hence, the correct answer is A (Decreased). (Ref: Harper's illustrated biochemistry 30th ed/Chapter 6 Pg 37)Explanation:Hemoglobins differ in their net charge due to differences in amino acids at specific sites.Hemoglobin S has an additional positive charge because it contains Val instead of Glu.This results in decreased negative charges leading to increased hydrophobicity.The altered protein migrates less than normal hemoglobins when subjected to electrophoretic analysis.Sickle Cell AnemiaThe most common inherited disorder affecting red blood cells.It occurs due to a missense mutation that changes one amino acid residue out of 14600 in b-globin chain of hemoglobin.Adenine is changed to thymidine resulting in substitution of valine for glutamate at position 6 of b-chain of globin moleculeThis causes polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin molecules into long fibrous aggregates called fibers.These fibers cause distoion of RBCs giving them characteristic sickle shape.Polymerized hemoglobin also increases membrane permeability to water and ions causing loss of potassium and sodium inside the cell along with influx of calcium and chloride.Ca2+ binds to spectrin and inhibits its function.F"

 g C i.e., Internal Carotid Aery
Hence, the correct answer is C (Internal carotoid aery). (Ref: Dhingra's ENT 5th/83-84; Scott Brown Vol II p. 1387)
Epistaxis Control - The internal maxillary aeries are controlled by ligation at its origin from external carotids. This can be done through retro mandibular approach. Ligation of anterior ethmoida! branch may also be required if bleeding persists after this step. If there is still no stoppage of bleed then posterior ethmoidals should be ligated. In some cases where all these steps fail to arrest bleeding, sphenopalatine aery must be identified & ligated.
Hence it is important to know that Internal carotic aery is not involved in Epistaxis management.
Ligation of vessels during surgery

In general surgical practice, ligation of blood vessels is avoided because of risk of ischemia due to occlusion of small branches which supply the organ itself. However, sometimes when major bleeder cannot be controlled by diathermy or clips, liga tion becomes necessary.

Prospective cohort studies - Follow-up study*** Cross-sectional studies are useful when it is impractical to conduct either case-control or cohort studies because of limited resources.*** They may be used to screen large numbers of people quickly and efficiently for signs of certain conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus etc.CASE CONTROL STUDIES** These are relatively inexpensive and simple to perform*** Cases and controls must have been exposed to suspected causal factor at some point in their lives*** But since both groups will have had different amounts of time during which they were exposed to the agent under investigation, adjustment should be made by matching on age, sex, occupation, smoking habits etc*** If there is no association between exposure & disease then ratio = 1*** Strengths include ease of implementation, low cost"

Question: APGAR acronym stands for?
Options:
A) Activity, pulse pressure, grimace, appearance, rate of respiration
B) Appearance, pressure, grimace, MAP, hea rate
C) Appearance, pressure, grimace, appearance, rate of hea beat
D) Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, respiration
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g
Explanation: Ans. is d i.e., Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration The Apgar score was devised by Dr Virginia Apgarf in 1952 to assess newborn infants immediately after bih (at one minute and five minutes). It includes : - Heart Rate Respiratory Effort Muscle Tone Reflex Irritability Color Score out of 10 with lower scores indicating greater need for neonatal care. Each component has been modified over time but it remains an impoant tool for assessing well-being at birth and guiding immediate management. In practice, however, there may be considerable inter-observer variation in scoring individual components. For example, some observers will give a higher score if the infant stas crying within seconds of stimulation than others who require more persistent stimulation before crying begins. Similarly, different people have varying thresholds for judging when muscle tone is adequate. There can also be confusion between active sucking movements which indicate good respiratory drive and rooting reflexes that occur earlier on during feeding. These variations make comparison difficult across centres and countries. Despite these limitations, the Apgars remain widely used because they are easy to perform and communicate results clearly. They should always be supplemented by clinical assessment of the baby's condition and fuher investigation where necessary. An"

Question: Most commonly implicated drug for acute liver failure is -
Options:
A) Paracetamol
B) Valproate
C) Warfarin
D) Tetracyclines
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g A i.e., Paracetoml Acetaminophen (Paracetam0I) toxicityQ - It can cause severe hepatotoxicity with massive hepatic necrosis & fulminant hepatitis. The mechanism of injury involves depletion of glutathione by formation of reactive metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine which causes centrilobular necrosis. Risk factors include chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, fasting, smoking, microsomal enzyme inducers like phenytoin, barbiturates, rifampicin etc. Treatment includes gastric lavage within hours after ingestion; administration of acetylcysteine to replenish glutathionc stores; maintenance of hydration, electrolytes, glucose, and oxygenation; and monitoring of vital signs and mental status. Liver transplantation may be required in cases of severe poisoning.
Hence, the correct answer is A (Paracamot). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 18th edition pg 305-306 table 302-1).

Explanation: Ans. (a) B-CellRef: Kanski 7/e p736; Parson 20/e p484Most common primary orbital tumor is Lymphomas - NHL > Hodgkins lymphoma.Most common histological subtype of Primary Orbital Lymphoma is Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphomaa. The most frequent clinical presentation is painless proptosisb. CT scan shows homogenous mass with no calcificationc. MRI can show infiltration into adjacent structuresd. Biopsy should be taken to confirm diagnosise. Treatment is chemotherapy +/- radiotherapyf. Prognosis is good if treated early
Hence, the correct answer is A (B-cell). (Ref: Khurana 6th/ e p432)Primary intraocular tumors are more common than those involving the orbit.Primary ocular adnexal malignancies account for <1% of all cancers.Orbit is involved by direct extension in 10% cases & metastasis in 5%.Orbital involvement occurs commonly due to breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, kidney cancer, thyroid cancer, stomach cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, leukemia, myeloma, sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma & chorioc"
