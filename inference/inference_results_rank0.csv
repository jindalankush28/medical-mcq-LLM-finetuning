Tropicamide - It has two enantiomers, d-tropic acid & l-tropic amide. The active form is D-isomer which acts on M3 receptors in ciliary muscle to produce cycloplegia. Its action lasts for 15 minutes. Tropics can be used alone at concentration of 5% or combined with phenylephrine hydrochloride at concentrations of 0·025% or 0•05%. Phenylephride prevents redness due to vasodilatation caused by tropicamidc. At lower doses it causes mydriasis but no appreciable cyclopelgia. It is useful when pupillary dilatation without loss of accommodation is required e.g. fundus examination. It also reduces the amount of fluorescein dye needed during tonography.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g B i.e., Pre Botzinger Complex
Hence, the correct answer is B (Pre-Botzingner complex). (Ref: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology 23rd/ pg 593-594; Guyton & Hall Textbook Of Medical Physiology - Page 555)
The preBotzinger complex in the ventrolateral medulla has been identified as an essential component of the central pattern generator that controls rhythmic breathing movements.
It contains pacemaker cells with intrinsic rhythms between 8 to 12 Hz which can be entrained by signals coming from higher brain centers.
In addition to this, it also receives inputs from vagus nerve and carotid body chemoreceptors.
This area sends excitatory output to phrenic motor nucleus via both local interneurons and long-range projections through spinal cord.
Pacemaker activity within the preBotcinger complex generates inspiratory ramp signal that drives respiration.
Hence the correct choice here is pre-botzinger complexes.
Note:

Ventral respiratory neurons are involved in forced expiration during intense exercise.
Pneumotactic centre helps control rate of inspiration by limiting duration of inspiratory phase.

D) 1, increases
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Oxygen binding by hemoglobin is increased in alkalosis (high pH). The Bohr effect describes this phenomenon. In addition, when carbon dioxide levels increase, it causes an acidotic state that shifts the curve to the right, increasing oxygen delivery to tissues. This is why tissue hypoxia can be caused by inadequate blood flow rather than low paial pressure of oxygen. Another factor affecting oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation is 2-3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPQ), which is produced during glycolysis within red cells. It has two phosphate groups attached to adjacent carbons on one molecule of phosphoenolpyruvate. When deoxygenated haemoglobins bind with 2.3-BiG, they have lower affinities for O2. Thus, high concentrations of 2;3-BIG promote release of Q2 at the tissue level. Ref : Biochemistry By U. Satyanarayana 3rd edition Pgno : 240
Hence, the correct answer is A (4, decreased). On combining both factors i.e., pH & BPG, we get - ""The combination of acidic conditions and elevated 2,3-DPG produces the greatest shift"

D) Mask with reservoir
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Oxygen delivery system Concentration (%) Flow rate (L/min) Use Nasal Cannula 28-44 1 -2 As needed Face mask 40% 5-10 Acute respiratory failure Non rebreathing mask 60-80 6-12 Severe acute respiratory distress Ventilator Any > 8 Mechanical ventilation Endotracheal intubation Any >8 Intensive care unit
Hence, the correct answer is D (Mask with reservoir). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 18th edition pg 1629 table 258-3)
The highest flow rates listed in this table can deliver up to 100 percent O2 by using an FIO2 of 1.0. The lowest flow rates will still give you adequate amounts of supplemental O2 at lower concentrations. For example, if your patient needs 35 percent O 2, then use nasal prongs at 2 L/ min. If they need more than that, such as 50 percent, then switch them over to simple face masks at 5 L /min.

### Response:
 g
Hence, the correct answer is C (0%). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th edition, Page 2595).Explanation:Hepatitis B virus infection can be classified into three phases based on HBV DNA levels and presence or absence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg): high infectivity with high viral replication; low infectivity but still active viral replication due to mutations that reduce virion secretion; and very low infectivities with minimal viral replication.HBeAg-positive chronic infections have higher rates of virologic relapse than do HBeAg-negative infections after treatment cessation.The risk of perinatal transmission varies widely depending upon maternal markers of disease activity.Mothers who are HBeAG-Positive and Anti-HBs negative have an approximately 90% chance of transmitting the virus to their offspring whereas mothers who are both HBe AG -negative and anti-HBs positive have less than 10% chance.Patients with acute hepatitis B may also transmit the virus during pregnancy.Perinatal TransmissionRisk of Perinatal Transmision (%)MotherInfantAnti-HBC +veAnti-HBS+ ve<10%Anti-HBG +veanti-HBS-ve>80%Anti-BG +ve, anti-HBS"

### Response:
 g B i.e., Atropin
Hence, the correct answer is B (Atropine). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 18th ed / Chapter 46.)The symptoms described in the question suggest that it is a case of atropinic poisoning. The management includes administration of physiologic amounts of anticholinergic drugs such as atropine.Atropine has no effect on muscaranic receptors but competitively inhibits acetyl choline action by blocking M1 -M3 receptor sites. It does not cross BBB so there will be no CNS effects.It can also antagonize histamine mediated responses due to H1 blockade.The dose required depends upon severity of symptoms; usually 0.5-2 mg IV every 10 minutes until dryness of mouth occurs. If tachycardia develops, reduce doses to 0-05mg every 30 min.Physostigminewill increase the activity of all types of endogenous cholinesterase enzymes including pseudocholinesterases which may result in excessive muscle weakness and paralysis.Flumazenilextractable benzodiazepines like diazepam, flurazepam, lorazepam & temazepam.Neostigmina reversible inhibitor"

### Response:
 g TPP (Thiamine pyrophosphate)
Hence, the correct answer is B (TPP). (Ref: Harper's illustrated biochemistry 30th edition page no 179 table 14-1).
 
Glycogen phosphorylases catalyze the rate-limiting step in glycolysis by cleaving α(1→4)-glycosidic bonds between glucose residues of glycogen to produce linear glucan oligosaccharides with free aldehyde groups at their reducing ends. The reaction requires Mg2+ ions and occurs via an enol intermediate that forms through deprotonation of C-1 of glucose by thiamin diphosphate (vitamin B1), which acts as coenzyme.

The enzyme has two domains:

* A smaller N-terminal domain contains the active site where substrate binding takes place; this domain also binds the cofactor thiamine diphoshate (vitamine B1);
* A larger C-terminal domain provides structural support to the protein and helps position the substrate correctly within the active-site cleft

 g) The most common cause of fetal anemia in Rh isoimmunization (anti-D antibody). Other antibodies include anti-C, -E, -K, -G, -Jka, -M, -S, -Yt, and less commonly, anti-LW and anti-cw. Rarely, patients with multiple red cell antigens may have severe disease due to combined sensitization. Fetal loss can occur if maternal levels exceed 1 :8. Maternal titer should be checked at least every trimester until delivery. If it reaches 1:16, weekly monitoring by Doppler ultrasound is recommended. A decrease in peak systolic velocity >3 cm/s indicates significant fetal anemiag. Ultrasound evaluation includes assessment of amniotic fluid volume, middle cerebral artery flow velocities, and cardiac function. Amniocentesis provides information on direct Coombs test positivity and allows quantification of bilirubin level. Cordocentisis assesses hematocrit directly but carries risks of hemorrhage and karyotype abnormalities. Reference : page 1019 Williams Obstetrics 24th edition

### Response:
 g. The pfannensteil incision is an oblique suprapubic skin incision that splits the rectus abdominis muscles to access the pelvic organs. It can be extended superiorly into the subcostal region if needed. This approach has been used in gynecologic surgery since the late nineteenth century. In modern times it is most commonly performed during cesarean section when there is no need to open the upper abdomen. Other uses include hysterectomy, sacrocolpopexy, and repair of uterine prolapse. Complications may occur with this type of abdominal wall incision including wound infection, seroma formation, hematoma, hernia, adhesions, and bowel injury. These complications have decreased significantly over time due to improvements in surgical technique and postoperative care. Ref : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/aicles/PMC4441116/

### Response:
 g The retinoblastoma protein (Rb), encoded by the RB1 locus located on chromosome band 13q14, is an impoant tumor suppressor that regulates progression through the cell cycle. 
hence it acts to prevent uncontrolled proliferation in cells.

Reference-Robbins basic pathology 9th edition pg-86
Hence, the correct answer is C (The cell cycle will progress and tbe cell will divide). (-a). (Ref Robbins 8/e p87; fig 3-7)
Hence the correct Answer is C ((The cell cyele wil! progress and tb e cel l wi ll dive). (- Ref : Robbin's Basic Pathology 9/e p88 ). Explanation: Retinoblstomma Protein It was first identified because mutations in this gene cause familial retin oblastomas. But now we know that loss of function of this protein can lead to many different types of cancer. This protein binds to E2F transcription factors and prevents them from turning on genes required for DNA synthesis and mitosis. When the normal allele of the RB gene is lost, the remaining mutant copy cannot bind to E 2 F, so these proteins go ahead with their job of promoting"

Hence, the correct answer is A (Chief cells). (Ref: Guyton Physiology 10th ed pg 409-413; Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology 23rd Ed Ch. 25.)The intestinal mucosa has many finger-like projections called villi that increase its surface area. Each villus contains capillaries, lymphatic vessels, nerve fibers, smooth muscle bundles, and glands called the crypts. These structures have their own blood supply, so they can absorb nutrients independently of one another.The intestinal wall also contains numerous folds called plicae circulares, especially prominent in the jejunum. In addition, there may be circular folds within the lumen of the intestine itself, particularly in the proximal small bowel.Both these features serve to increase the absorptive surface area of the intestines.In humans, the total length of the gastrointestinal tract is approximately 9 meters"

### Response:
 g C i.e., (HR/SBP) (171- Ananthanarayan 7th)* Shock Index = Heart rate / Systolic blood pressure* It has been found to be useful in predicting moality after trauma.* A value of >0.9 was associated with increased risk of death.* The normal range is <1.0*** Modified Shock Index=Heart Rate/systolic BP** - Useful predictor of outcome in patients with blunt chest injury*** Tachycardia may occur due to pain, anxiety, hypovolemia, sepsis, hemorrhage etc.* Bradycardias can result from head injuries, spinal cord lesions, drugs like b blocker, morphine, alcohol intoxication etc.
Hence, the correct answer is C (HR/SPB). (Ref: Textbook of Surgery by Sabiston 19th ed; pg no. 191)
The text below is copied from internet which clearly states that ""Shock index is calculated using systolic blood pressures"" so it rules out all options except one.

D) 3 minutes
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 gans in the trachea is to remove mucus plugs that can cause atelectasis (collapse of lung tissue). The goal when performing endotracheal suctioning is to clear all visible debris while minimizing trauma to the mucosa. Suction catheters come in various sizes; however, they must always be smaller than the internal diameter of the tube. A common size used is one-half the inside diameter of an adult's endotrachial tube. For example, if using a 7 mm ID ET tube, then use a 3.5 mm suction catheter. When removing secretions with a suction cathenter, it is impoant to keep the negative pressure less than -100mmHg because this will prevent barotrauma to the airways. It takes approximately 10 to 15 seconds to perform effective removal of secretions. If you have to repeat more than three times, stop immediately and notify your physician. This may indicate that there is too much volume being drained from the patient and/or that the patient needs to be weaned off the ventilator. Ref : Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Pg no : 761

### Response:
 g
Hence, the correct answer is A (VLDL). (Ref: Harper's illustrated biochemistry 31st ed. Page no- 262)
Hence D i.e. Chylomics
Explanation: Electrophoretic mobility of Lipoprotein increases with increasing density & decreasing size. So among all lipoprotiens, HDL has maximum electrophoretc mobility followed by LDL > VLDl> chylomicron. Hence when we do electrophorisis on serum proteins, they will be separated into bands according to their charge. The band which moves fastest is alpha -1 band (alpha fetoprotein), next one is beta band (lipids like cholesterol etc.), then gamma band (immunoglobulins) and lastly delta band (haptoglobin).
Hence,

### Response:
 golgi body.jpg
Hence, the correct answer is B (Golgi bodies). (Ref : Textbook of medical biochemistry Dr Chatterjee 8th edition page no-3)
Hence the correct Answer is B (Golgi bodies).
Note - The image shows golgi apparatus which consists of stacks of flattened sacs called cisternae that have associated tubules extending outwards in all directions. These structures form an extensive network within the cell. 
The outer surface of the stack has budding profiles known as cis-tubule and trans-tubules. Cis-tubuli bud off to fuse with the endoplasmatic reticulam while the trans-tubes bud off into the cytoplasm forming secretory vesicle. This process is responsible for packaging proteins synthesized by ribosomes attached to rough ER into transport vesicles destined for secretion outside the cells. 
In addition, some materials may be transferred directly between adjacent cisternal membranes without passing through the lumen of the organelle. Such transfer can occur either towards the cis side or the trans side of the complex. Thus, the function of the golgi complex is to sort protein molecules packaged in membrane-bound vesicles according to their destination inside or outside"

 g. (HIV) (121- Ananthanarayan 7th)* The risk of transmission of hepatitis B by blood products has been reduced to less than one in million.* Hepatitis C can be transmitted through contaminated needles but there have been no reports of its transmission by blood transfusions* Risk of AIDS transmission with screening of donated blood is now very low (<1 per million units)**.Screening tests used include antibody detection test using ELISA, Western blotting and p24 antigen capture assay*** Screening of all donations for anti-HIV antibodies and nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) for viral RNA or DNA reduces the risk of post-transfusion HIV infection to < 0.0002%**. But it does not eliminate this risk completely because window period may exist between initial exposure to virus and appearance of detectable levels of circulating markers such as antibodies or antigens.Hepatitis A - It is spread mainly by feco oral route. Blood borne transmission accounts for only 3 % cases. So it cannot be transmitted by screened blood transfusion.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Adhesive failures at the interface between the two materials (metal-ceramic bond) can be caused by poor bonding techniques, inadequate surface preparation, contamination during cementation, excessive occlusal loading, fatigue due to repeated stress cycling, and differences in coefficients of thermal contraction between the alloy and ceramic.

Ref: Phillips Ed 12th pg 373
Hence, the correct answer is B (Adhesive failure). (marking adhesive failure as an incorrect answer was a mistake on my part).
The most common cause of debonding is difference in their coefficients of linear thermal expansion. The higher the mismatch in these values, the greater will be the residual stresses developed when they cool down after being heated up during sintering process. This causes cracking around margins which ultimately leads to debond-ing.

Sugarcane contains sucrose (table sugar), so giving it to this patient resulted in increased amount of fructose in blood → Hypoglycaemia & hyperfructosaemia.

Hepatosplenomagaly occurs due to deposition of glycogen in liver cells.
Reducing substance test positive because fructose can be converted into glucose by aldose reductase pathway.
So, most likely diagnosis here is hereditary fructose intolerance caused by deficiency of aldolase-B.
Fructokinases deficiency causes essential fructo-urania, but there will be no hepatomegalv and hypogIycernia.
Glucconeogenesis is defective in Von Gierke's disease causing hypoglcvcnia, hepatomeglav and reducing substance test postive.

### Response:
 g A i.e., PlateletQVon Willebrand's disease (vWD) - It is an inherited disorder of platelet function characterized bv prolonged bleeding time & defective adhesion of platelets to damaged vascular endothelium. vWF is synthesized in megakaryotes & stored within alpha granules of plateletes; it is also secreted by endothelial cells. The major clinical manifestation of this condition is excessive bruising & mucosal hemorrhage. Bleeding usually sta with small blood vessels such as capillaries & arterioles but can involve larger ones like veins. Epistaxis, menorrhagia, hematuria, GI haemorrhages etc may occur. Diagnosis depends on demonstration of reduced plasma levels of vWF antigen & ristocetin cofactor activity. Treatment includes desmopressin which releases vWF from storage sites in platelets & increases its level in circulation. Recombinant FVIII concentrate containing high concentration of vWf is used when desmoprassin fails.

The radiographic image quality depends on:

Resolution
Contrast

Resolution refers to ability to distinguish between two closely placed objects in an object field.
It can be measured by means of line pairs per millimeter (lp/mm).
Intraoral film has a resolution of approximately 8 lp/mm while that of intraoral digital sensor ranges from 12 to 20 lp/mm.
Panoramic images have a lower resolution than periapical films.

Contrast refers to visibility of differences in gray scale values within the subject being imaged.
Higher contrast results when there is greater difference in density between adjacent areas of the subject.
Contrast may vary with different processing techniques used for same type of film or receptor.
Digital receptors offer better contrast compared to conventional dental X-ray film.
Hence it is important to use high-resolution sensors along with optimal exposure parameters to obtain diagnostic-quality images.
Radiographs should always include sufficient information regarding patient’s name, date taken, tooth number, and area of interest so that they can be easily identified at"

### Response:
 g C i.e., Vipehalm
Hence, the correct answer is C (Vipeholm). (Ref: Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine by K Park, 21st edition, page no. 555)
The Vipeholn Study conducted between 1947-1953 demonstrated that dietary restriction of sugar reduced caries incidence significantly.
It also showed that there were significant reductions in caries when fluoride toothpaste was used twice daily instead of once daily.
However, it failed to show an effect on caries reduction with addition of mottled enamel powder to the dentifrice.
This study concluded that dental caries could be controlled through changes in diet and oral hygiene practices.

Hence, the correct answer is C (0.06 to 08%). (Ref : Phillips science of dental materials 12th ed pg 46). 
Note - Carbon content can vary between 0·5–1·3 per cent depending on type of alloy used.
Stainless Steel Alloys

The stainless steels contain at least 10·5 per cent chromium by weight; this gives them their characteristic corrosion resistance. The addition of molybdenum improves high temperature strength and resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion. Nickel may be added to improve formability and reduce work hardening during fabrication.

Types of Stainless Steels Used in Dentistry

Type 304 contains no more than 0•08 per cent nitrogen and less than 20 ppm of sulphur and phosphorus. It has good ductility but poor weldability due to its low nickel content. Type 316 contains higher levels of both nickel and molybdemum which makes it easier to fabricate and stronger when welded. This material also resists stress-corrosion cracking better than type 304.

D) Uncal herniation
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g C i.e., Pharmacological blockage
Hence, the correct answer is C (Pharmacological blockade). (Ref: Kanski Clinical Ophthalmology 6th/e p. 55-56; Parson Diseases of Eye 20th/ep. 30-31)
Topical instillation of pilocarpine produces miosis by acting on M3 receptors present at iris sphincter muscle. It will fail to cause miosis if there is pharmacologic blockade of muscarinic receptor due to anticholinergic drugs like Atropine & homatropine etc.
Adie's Tonic pupil - In this condition, pupils do not constrict with near reflex but they can construct when stimulated directly with light. So it does not explain failure of pupillary contraction after topical application of miotic agent.
Diabetes mellitus may lead to diabetic papillopathy which presents with bilateral mild-moderate disc edema without hemorrhages or exudates. But it has no effect on pupillary function.
Uncal hernation causes compression of ipsilateral oculomotor nerve leading to mydriasis and ptosis. However, it doesnot affect contralateral pupil so that both pupils remain unequal in size. Thus un"

### Response:
 g B i.e., Facial arteryFacial Aery - It arises from external carotid & ascends in front of parotid gland to reach face.It lies between facial vein & stylohyoid muscle.At its bifurcation into superior labial & lateral nasal branches it crosses upper border of maxilla just behind nasolabial fold (smile lines).It can be felt pulsating on this line when pressed against cheek with finger tipQ.The terminal branch of facial aery is submental aery which runs along mylohyoideus below chin & anastomoses with submandibular aery.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Facial artery). (Ref: BD Chaurasia 7th / Vol-3 pg 120)
The superficial temporal artery is located above the zygomatic arch, while the lingual artery is found medial to the hyoglossus muscle. The maxillary artery does not lie near the surface; rather, it is buried within the infratemporal fossa.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Griseo-fulvin absorption is enhanced by food paicularly fat rich meals because it binds to chylomicrons in GIT & gets absorbed along with them.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Griseofolvin). (Ref - KD Tripathi Pharmacology 7th edition page no 819)
The bioavailability of griseofuhvin increases when taken orally on a high-fat diet; this may be due to binding of drug to dietary lipids that enhances intestinal uptake. The plasma t½ ranges between 6 hr and 12 hr. It has been reported that CYP2C9 metabolizes griseo-fuhvin into an inactive metabolite, but there have also been reports suggesting that C3P3Al can contribute significantly to its metabolism. However, these findings need fuher confirmation.

### Response:
 g HSL (Hormone sensitive lipase)
Hence, the correct answer is B (Hornome-sensitive lipose). (but it's better to remember that all hormones except insulin stimulate hormone sensitive lipolysis).
Hence the correct answe is B.(Hornomes such as epinephrine, norepinephrine & Glucagons increase activity of this enzyme whereas Insulin decreases its activity.). Ref : Biochemistry By U. Satyanarayana 3rd Ed Page 136; Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry 28th ed page no- 214
Hence B is the most appropriate answer here.
Note - All hormones except Insulin increases the activity of HSL.
Hence there is an exception in this case.
So if you have more than one option with same value then go ahead and mark them both.
But don't forget to mention the reference also.

### Response:
 g D i.e., Factor XIIIFactor Xllla (Fibrin stabilizing factor)Q plays an impoant role in wound healing by causing covalent bonding between fibrin monomers to form insoluble polymers that strengthen the hemostatic plug.Fibrinogen is conveed into fibrin under the influence of thrombin which causes polymerization of fibrin molecules & formation of mesh like network around platelets.Thus, it forms basis of primary hemostasis. It also activates factor V111a (fibrinolysis inhibitor).Factor Vlla can activate prothrombin activator complex (Tissue factor - VIIa - tissue factor pathway inhibitor), thus amplifying the process of activation of procoagulant factors such as IXa, VIIIa, XIa, and IIa (prothrombina).
Hence, the correct answer is D (Factor XIII). (Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, South Asian Edition, 8th/e p120-121; Wintrobe's Clinical Hematology, 12th edition, pg no: 107)

 gutlight.com/.../desmoid-tumors.html - Desmoid tumors (also known as aggressive fibromatosis)... The most common symptom of an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor is that it causes no symptoms at all.... In some cases, patients may have vague complaints such as bloating, cramping, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, fever, fatigue, weakness, and/or night sweats.... A large number of these tumors can cause bowel obstruction which results in severe abdominal pain, vomiting and inability to pass gas.... If they grow into adjacent structures, they can also cause urinary frequency due to compression on the bladder, difficulty swallowing because of pressure on the esophagus, and even paralysis if nerves are involved.... They do not spread through blood vessels so metastasis does not occur. However, they tend to invade surrounding tissues aggressively. This means that surgical removal is difficult and recurrence rates after surgery are high.... Treatment with chemotherapy has been shown to be effective in shrinking the size of the tumor but this effect is temporary. Radiation therapy is usually ineffective. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 780

 g) Inherited form of renal stone disease (cystinuria) results due to defective reabsorption of cysteine in PCT. It causes formation of stones composed mainly of cystein monohydrate with occasional presence of calcium oxalate and uric acid.

Harshmohan textbook of pathology pg no-671
Hence, the correct answer is D (Recurrent urinary calicii). Note - Option c is incorrect because deposition occurs in interstitium & not in RBCs.
Hence among the given options d i.e., recurrent urinary calculi is the most appropriate answer.
Option e

In hereditary hypercalciuria there will be increased excretion of calcium in urine which may lead to nephrocalcinosis and kidney stones.
The commonest cause of idiopathic hypercalcemia is primary hyperparathyroidism.
Hyperoxaluria leads to development of calcium oxalate stones.
Excess absorption of dietary protein can result in excess production of ammonia that combines with ammonium magnesium phosphate to produce struvite stones.
Increased levels of uric acids can precipitate out at acidic pH resulting in uric-acid stones.

D) 200
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g) First quaile (Q1): Value below which 25% of observations lie Third quaile(Q3):Value below which 75 %of observation lies Q2 is median i.e., value below which half of the values lie So, in this case, 150 people will be having their B.P. between 94-110mmHg.
Hence, the correct answer is C (100). (+)ve sign indicates that it is above the median whereas (-)sign indicates that the value is less than the median. Median = Q2= middle value when all values arranged in ascending order of magnitude. If total number of values is odd then median is equal to middle value otherwise average of two middle values. For example if we arrange 5 numbers in increasing order : 10,15,20,30,40 then median would be 20 because it is exactly at the center. But if we take same set with one more element like {6} so now our sequence becomes 10,15,18,20,30, 40.

Other causes include maternal vascular disease such as preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, systemic lupus erythematosus with antiphospholipid antibodies, renal disease, smoking, cocaine use, poor nutrition, and multiple gestations. Fetal factors that may contribute to IUGRs include chromosomal abnormalities, congenital malformations, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, Rh isoimmunization, and post-term pregnancy. Ultrasound parameters used to assess fetal bih weight include biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), and femur length (FL).
Hence, the correct answer is C (Abdominal circulation). (Ref: Textbook of Obstetrics D.C.Dutta 6th edition page no-310)
The American College of Radiology recommends using the abdominal circumference measurement alone when assessing for intrauterine growth restriction because it has been shown to be more accurate than the biparietaldiameter or femurlength measurements alone. In addition, the abdominalcircumference can detect asymmetric IUGRand predict neonatal morbidity better than either symmetric IUGRo r"

D) Mistake in lab technique
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 gans (Hepatocytes). Bilirubin is then conjugated by UGT1A1 to form monoglucuronide biliprotein complexes that can be excreted into bile. These complexes consist of one molecule of unconjugated bilirubinate bound to two molecules of glucuronic acid. Conjugation occurs within vesicles called canalicular vesicles. Once formed, these vesicles fuse with the apical membrane of hepatocyte cells and release their contents directly into the lumen of the bile ducts. This process is known as primary active transpo. Bile salts also play a role in regulating the flow of bilir ubin through the liver. They bind to the ABC half-transporter protein on the basolateral surface of the hepatocyte cell membrane. When there is sufficient intracellular concentration of UDP-gluc uronyl transferase enzyme, it binds to the cytoplasmic side of the ABC transporter protein. This causes conformational changes in the protein structure which allows binding of the complex to another ABC transport protein located at the apoplastic side ofthe membrane. This second ABC protein forms a heterodimer with the first ABC protein and together they undergo fuher structural changes allowing them to span both sides of the"

HemoglobinopathiesHemoglobins are tetramers composed of two pairs of globin chains; in humans, there are six different types of globins that can be combined to form hemoglobin molecules.Hemoglobin A (normal adult hemoglobin), which contains 2a-chains and 2 b-chains, accounts for more than 95% of circulating hemoglobin.The most common abnormal hemoglobin is sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS), an example of a structurally altered mutant protein caused by replacement of one amino acid residue within the b-chain with another.A number of inherited disorders result from mutations affecting either the synthesis of globulin chains or their assembly into functional hemoglobin tetram ers.These include thalas semias, which represent a spectrum of clinically related but genetically heterogeneous hereditary hemolytic anemia s associated with reduced amounts of specific g lobin chains.In general, these conditions reflect"

D) Air in middle ear
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 giving answer as A i.e. Change in Specific Gravity Of Lungs
Hence, the correct answer is A (Change in specificgravity of lungs). (Ref: Textbook of Forensic Medicine & Toxicology; Vishnu Mohan Reddy; 5th edition; Page no: 55)
Hence change in specific gravities of lung indicates that it was born alive and died soon after bih.
Ploucquets Test

It is used to determine whether an infant has been bom dead or lived for some time before death.

The test depends on the fact that when the lungs float on water they indicate that they have become aerated with air during life.
In this test, the freshly removed lungs are weighed while wet and then dried at 70-80°C until constant dry weights are obtained.
Then their difference in weight gives the amount of fluid absorbed by them.
If the ratio between the wet and dry weight exceeds 3.2, it shows that the child had breathed before birth.
This method can be applied up to 24 hours after delivery but becomes unreliable thereafter because of putrefaction changes in the lungs.
Hence the correct choice here is A, which refers to ""change in specific gravity of lung"".

D) 50 mg
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Option b : The half-life (t1/2 )of this drug can be calculated by dividing time to eliminate one-half of the dose by log(0.5). t1/20.693x90=4 hr Therefore, every four hours approximately half of the amount of drug present at that point in time has been eliminated. After six hours, therefore, three half-lives have passed, so there should be 125mg remaining out of an original 200mg. Ref: Lippincott Illustrated Reviews Pharmacology By Richard D. Brummett page 16-17.
Hence, the correct answer is B (25 mg). (+)ve sign indicates elimination whereas (-)ve signs indicate accumulation.

### Response:
 g Perinatal Moality Rate (PMBR): It is defined as ""the ratio of stillbihs plus deaths within first week to total number of live bih"". PMBR = No.of late fetal & early neonatal death/No. of live birth x1000 Ref : Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine; 24th edition - Page no. 58
Hence, the correct answer is B (Total live bihes). The most commonly used indicator of infant mortality is perinatol moality which includes all foetal deaths after 22 weeks gestation and all postnatal deaths up to one week. This measure has been adopted by WHO because it reflects more accurately than IMR the quality of antenatal care services available during pregnancy and also the conditions prevailing at delivery. In India, however, both these rates have been separately calculated since 1979. Perinatolo moality is expressed as a rate per 1,000 live biis. Peri-natal moalities include late foetal losses (>28 wks), fresh still-bih weights >1000 gm., and early neo-natal deaths (<7 days).

### Response:
 g. Less than 60°

Instrument Formula of GV Black:

Primary Cutting Edge Angle – Secondary Cutting Edge Angles = 30-40° 
The sum of both angles is approximately equal to 100 degrees.

Cutting Edge Angle (CEA): 

It is defined as an angle formed between long axis of tooth preparation and inclined plane of the blade at its junction with the base of the burr. It can also be described as the angle that determines the efficiency of removal of enamel and dentin during cavity preparations. The CEA has been divided into two parts: Primary cutting edge and secondary cutting edge. These have different functions in preparing teeth. 
Primary cutting edge is used primarily for removing hard tissue whereas secondary cutting edges remove soft tissues such as caries and debris. 
In general, it is recommended that the primary cutting edges should be placed so that they form an acute angle (<60°) with the axial wall of the prepared tooth surface because this will allow efficient removal of hard dental structure without damaging the surrounding walls. In contrast, the secondary cutting-edge should be positioned more obliquely (>80°), which allows effective removal of softer materials like carious dentine and plaque biofilm. This positioning may result in less damage to the adjacent structures when"

### Response:
 g. The presence of delusions of both grandeur (i.e., being overvalued by others) and persecution (i,e., undervaluation by others), along with auditory hallucinations that reinforce these beliefs, suggests schizophrenia. Auditory hallucinations may be either voices heard inside one's head or outside; they can also take on various forms such as hearing music or sounds. In some cases, patients report feeling touched or moved around by unseen forces. These experiences usually occur when there has been an acute exacerbation of symptoms. However, it should be noted that many people who have experienced psychotic episodes do not develop chronic schizophrenia.Diagnosis: Schizophrenia
Hence, the correct answer is C (Delusion of gran­diosity and persecution). (Note - This type of ques­tion requires knowledge of psychiatric disorders).

### Response:
 g C i.e., Positional Asphyxia - In positional asphyxias there is no compression of neck vessels & airways but due to body weight on chest (as in jack knife position), diaphragm cannot contract & lungs can't expandQ. So victim dies of hypoxia. It occurs when person falls into water with head down (drowning). When drunkard lies face down in ditch, he may die of this cause. Similarly if an obese person sleeps lying flat on his back, he also gets killed because of same reasons. This type of asphyxic death has been repoed after sleeping in prone position while intoxicated; in strychnine poisoning where muscle spasm causes flexion at hips & knees so that feet rest against thighs; in cases of acute pancreatitis where abdominal pain forces patient to lie in such a way that abdomen rests on lower ribs; in case of severe burns over anterior aspect of chest which prevents expansion of thorax etc.

The risk may be low when there is extensive mosaicsm but high when most of the cells have an abnormality. In general, however, these patients should be counseled regarding their increased risk of having children with chromosomal abnormalities. Recurrent miscarriage also can occur in women who have mosaic trisomy 16. This condition probably results from nondysjunction during meiosis I followed by postzygotic loss of one of the two copies of chromosome 16 in some but not all embryonic cells. Because this process occurs after fertilization, it does not result in liveborn offspring with trisomies involving chromosome 1 6. Women with recurrent pregnancy losses and normal karyotypes should undergo FISH analysis for trisomic 16 using DNA probes specific for chromosome 10. If such testing reveals trisomics among the circulating fetal cells, then prenatal diagnosis should be"

### Response:
 g Nicotinic cholinergic receptor (ganglion type)
Hence, the correct answer is D (Postsynaptic nicotine receptors). (Ref: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology Twenty-Third Edition Page No: 95).
Ganglionic Transmission

The preganglionic autonomic neurons have axons that run in both sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways to synapse on post ganglionic cells in either sympathetic ganglia or cranial nerve nuclei.

Preganglionic fibers are all myelinated; they contain acetylcholine as their neurotransmitter and release it at chemical synapses onto postganglionic cell bodies or dendrites within the ganglia.

Postgangllic fibres are unmyelinated except those going to sweat glands which are myelined. They also contain ACh as transmitter substance but release it into effector organs rather than onto postsynaptic neuron.
Acetylcholines acts through two types of receptors:

Muscarinic - present on smooth muscles, cardiac muscle & glandular epithelia.
Nicotine – present on gangliosomatic junctions.
Hence Nicotinic Cholinergic Receptor (ganglions type) mediate ganglioni ctransmission.

Uniparenteral Disomy (UPD)
It occurs when two copies of chromosome come from one parent instead of both parents contributing to that particular chromosome segment.
Examples include:

Prader Willi Syndrome - UPD on paternal chromosome 15q11-q13
Angelman Syndrome - maternal deletion of 15 q11-q12 or UPD of this region on Maternal Chromosome

Russell Silver Syndrome - It has been associated with maternal Uniparentel Disomy of Paternal Chromosomes 7.
Hence, the correct answer is D (Bloom syndrome). (Ref: Nelson's 20th edition; Page no. 661 & 662)
The text in red color indicates ""Remember"" points.

 gut iron absorption is regulated by two proteins in the apical membrane of intestinal cells (enterocytes): ferroportin and divalent metal transporter -1 (DMT-1). The uptake of dietary Fe2+ across the brush border of duodenal epithelial cells involves DMT1, an iron-regulated basolateral transpoer that mediates bidirectional movement of metals including Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, and Cr3+. Ref : guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology 12 edition page number: 419,420,421
Hence, the correct answer is A (DMTs-1).. (Ref: Guyton & Hall Physiology Review - 22nd Ed Ch. 39)
The most impoant step in iron metabolism is the transfer of iron from ferritin to transferrin. This process requires reduction of ferric ion to ferrous form. Apoferritin can bind six molecules of transferrrin at its surface. Each molecule of transfrrin binds one atom of iron. Ferritin has no role in transport of iron but it stores iron within cell.

 ganski dermatomes (e.g., Zimmer, Weck, and Stryker), which have adjustable blade angles to allow easy changes between different depths of tissue harvest. The most common type of dermatome is an oscillating dermatome that uses a rotating wheel with multiple blades attached to it. This allows for rapid sectioning through large areas of donor site while maintaining consistent depth control. A newer generation of handheld devices has been developed using computer-controlled micromotors to improve precision and accuracy. These instruments can be adjusted to cut at specific depths by changing the speed of rotation and angle of attack of the cutting edge. They also offer improved ergonomics compared with traditional mechanical dermatomes because they do not require manual pressure on the device during use.

### Response:
 g. All patients who have been diagnosed with TB should be considered suspects under DOTS (RNTCP). The diagnosis of pulmonary TB has already been confirmed in these cases before they were referred to DOTS centres. These patients do not need fuher investigation prior to initiation on treatment. They can directly be initiated on Category I treatment regimen. In case of suspected smear-negative PTB, chest X-ray examination may help confirm the presence of active disease. However, it must be remembered that chest radiography does not distinguish between infection and disease. Chest X-rays are therefore recommended only when there is clinical suspicion of PTB but no bacteriological evidence.

### Response:
 g D i.e. (Capping) (124- Harper 28th)* The addition of methyl groups to cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides within promoter regions of genes leads to gene silencing* This epigenetic change does not alter the base sequence but prevents transcription by altering chromatin structure.* In mammals, methylation occurs on both strands of double-stranded DNA, so that when one strand becomes unmethylated it can be replaced by de novo methylation**. Thus, once established, methylated sequences remain stably methylated through cell divisions*** Methylation also plays an impoant role in maintaining genomic stability by preventing recombination between homologous chromosomes during meiosis and by correcting mismatched bases formed during replication via the process of mismatch repair**** Transcription factors such as Sp1 bind specifically to unmethylate dDNA at GC-rich motifs called SP1 sites. When these sites become methylated, they lose their ability to interact with proteins involved in transcription initiation. Conversely, some regulatory elements may require methylation before they will function properly.

 g Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is characterized by : -


Injury to lungs in preterm neonates due to oxygen toxicity & barotrauma → Causes pulmonary hypertension.


Prolonged need for assisted ventilation with high inspired O2 concentration causes damage to alveolar epithelium leading to increased permeability of capillaries → Interstitial edema.

Pathological changes

The most characteristic feature is atelectasis which may be patchy or diffuse.
There is interstitial emphysema, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, subcutaneous emphysematous tissue.
Hyperexpansion of some areas of lung occurs along with collapse of others.
Bronchiectasis develops later on.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Air bronchographm on chest X-ray). (Ref: Nelson's 20th /e p 1721-1723)

Question: Renal feed for CKD patients-
Options:
A) Low calorie low volume
B) Low calorie high volume
C) High calorie low volume
D) High calorie high volume
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g B i.e., Low calorie & high volume Diet in chronic kidney disease (CKD) Patients with stage I-III of CKD should follow general dietary recommendations to maintain normal blood pressure, cholesterol levels, body weight, and glucose control. The main goal is to prevent progression of renal failure by reducing proteinuria and albuminuria. A diet that includes less than 1 g of salt per day may be recommended. Salt intake can also be reduced by avoiding foods such as canned goods, processed meats, restaurant meals, pickled vegetables, monosodium glutamate, soy sauce, fish sauce, miso paste, ketchup, tomato-based sauces, frozen dinners, and condiments. In addition, limiting fluid intake to <2 L/day has been shown to slow down GFR decline. Protein restriction is controversial; however, it appears to reduce proteinuria but does not affect long-term outcomes. It is suggested that daily protein intake be restricted to 0.8-1.12 g/kg/d. However, this recommendation needs fuher study because some studies have found no benefit on slowing the rate of loss of eGFR when compared with higher amounts of protein intake. Phosphorus restriction is impoant in advanced stages of CK D (>3). Dietary phosph"

D) 28
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g/dl = x ml/100ml blood
Hence, the correct answer is B (14). (Ref: Textbook of physiology N Geetha 2nd edition page no- 330)
Hence the correct Answer is B ((14)). (Ref :Text book of Physiology by N.Geeta - Page No 331).
Note :
Oxygen-carrying capacity of Hb in milliliters per deciliter of blood can be calculated using the formula:

1 mL of O2 / 0.033 mL/g Hgb × grams of Hgb

For example, if you have 15 g/dl of hemoglobin, your oxygen-carryng capacity would be:

1mLO2 /.033 mLO2/g HGB X 15 G/DL= 450 ML/O2 PER DECILITER OF BLOOD
The normal value for this calculation is approximately 20 mL of oxygen carried per 100 mL of blood.

### Response:
 g The olfactory system is responsible for detecting odorant molecules in air. The human nose can detect over one trillion different odors. This ability to perceive such an enormous variety of smells arises because humans have hundreds of different types of olfactory (smell-sensing) neurons that respond specifically to distinct chemical features found within odorant molecules.

Ref : Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology;24th edition; pg no- 75
Hence, the correct answer is D (Odorants). (Ref: Ganong’s review of medical physiology - 24/e p76)
Note: Olfactory receptor proteins belong to G protein-coupled receptor family. They are encoded by approximately 3500 genes out of more than 20,000 total genes in mammals. Each type of olfaction receptor has its own unique binding site on which specific odorant ligands bind.
Olfaction is mediated through the axons of sensory cells located high up in the nasal cavity epithelium.

### Response:
 gans (SOT), which is defined by an immunosuppressive regimen that includes calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). The most impoant adverse effect of this drug combination is increased susceptibility to infections caused by viruses, fungi, bacteria, and protozoa. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease remains one of the major complications after SOT.

### Response:
 gland type                                                        
holocrine                                 merocrine (eccrine)
apocrine                                                             apocrine
Hence, the correct answer is A (A). (Ref: Textbook of histology by Inderbir Singh 6th edition page no. 30). The diagram clearly depicts that in Holocrine glands, cells secrete their contents after they have been completely replaced with new secretory material; thus, dead cells are extruded along with secretion. This process results in an accumulation of keratinized debris at the center of the hair follicle. In contrast to this, merocrine sweat glands do not lose all of their cytoplasm when secreting substances into ducts. Apocrine glands release large membrane-bound vesicles containing most of the cell’s cytoplamic content but retain some basal portion of the cytoplams. Mucous acini of submandibular salivary glands show mixed exocrinic & endocrinic activity.
Hence the correct Answer is A ((A)). (Ref :Text book of Histology -Inderber singh- 7th ed p.no 31).

### Response:
 g B i.e., Cervial third of Crown
Hence, the correct answer is B (Cervical Third Of Crown). The pulp cavity in primary teeth has two main divisions : root canal & coronal part. Coronal part consists of pulp chamber which opens into root canals through apical foramen. Pulp chamber extends from cervical area to incisal edge. It is widest at its middle where it divides into two lobes by an internal ridge called cingulum tubercle. Internal surface of walls shows prominent dentin folds that project towards lumen of chamber. These are more numerous on mesio-buccal wall than others. On disto-lingual wall there is one large fold known as ""cusp pit"". At cervical end of chamber, floor forms a ledge like projection called ""pulp collar"" which projects onto the floor of chamber forming a small depression - ""collar pocket"".
Pulp Chamber Opening

The pulpal tissue within the tooth is contained within the pulp cavity, which communicates with the external environment via the apex of the root and the occlusal surfaces of the crowns.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Ref: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology; 24th edition; Page no: 71 Explanation: The Bezold- Jarisch reflex (BJR), also known as the Bezold Breur reflex, is an inhibitory baroreflex that occurs in response to activation of vagal C fiber receptors located within cardiopulmonary regions such as ventricles, atria, great vessels, pulmonary veins, and juxta capsular areas surrounding the hea. Activation of these receptors results in bradycardia, hypotension, apnea, and peripheral vasodilation. It has been shown that histamine can activate BJR at low concentrations (<10 nM). At higher concentrations (>1000 nM), it produces opposite effects on cardiovascular system i.e., tachycardic effect. This phenomenon is called biphasic action of histamine.

B) Secondary active transpo
C) Simple diffusion
D) Counter transpo
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Glucose uptake by intestinal cells occurs secondary to Na+ entry into these cells through an apical membrane cotranspoer (SGLT-1). The energy required for this process comes from the electrochemical gradient generated across the basolateral cell membranes by the Na+-K+ pump. This type of transpos system is called secondary active transpos because it uses the chemical potential created by another ion's concentration gradient rather than ATP directly.Ref: Guyton; 13th edition; Page no: 1012
Hence, the correct answer is B (Secondary active transpor). (Ref: Guytons physiology review - page 1008)
The SLC5 family includes sodium-dependent solute co-transpoers that mediate the movement of various substrates against their concentration gradients using the electrochemi-cal potential established by the sodium gradient maintained by the plasma mem-brane Na+/K+-ATPase pump. These proteins have been identified in many tissues including kidney tubules, small intestine, colon, brain, testis, placenta, liver, pancreas, salivary glands, lung, skeletal muscle, hea, blood vessels, adrenal gland, thyroid, eye, inner ear, olfactory epithelium, tongue, bone marrow,"

 gans (ADPKD), which occurs in approximately one in every 400 to 1,000 individuals worldwide. The prevalence varies by ethnicity; it affects 5% to 10% of whites but less than 0.2% of African Americans and Asians. ADPKD results from mutations in either PKD1 on chromosome 16p13.3 or PKD2 on chromosome lq21-23. Mutations in both genes lead to cyst formation within the kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen, and leptomeninges. Cysts may be found elsewhere, including the brain, hea, and joints. In addition, there can be cardiac valvular abnormalities, aoic aneurysms, colonic diverticula, and mitral valve prolapse. Most patients with ADPK D have no symptoms until their mid-to-late thirties. At that time they begin to experience pain due to compression of nerves and blood vessels by expanding cysts. Hematuria develops later in life because of rupture of small blood vessels into cysts or bleeding diathesis associated with platelet dysfunction. Hypertension is present in more than half of affected adults. ESRD typically begins at age 50 to 60 years"

### Response:
 g B i.e., Levonogesterol 0-75mg Post coital Contraception (Emergency Contraceptives) Emergency contraceptives can prevent pregnancy if used within 72 hrs of unprotected sex. The most effective method is levonorgesterol which should be staed at earliest possible time but no later than 12hrs postcoitus. It acts by inhibiting ovulation & preventing feilization. Other methods include combined oral pills containing ethinyl estradiol & norethisterone; progesterones like medroxyprogesterone acetate, mefepristone, mifepristene etc. Progestins act mainly on endometrium to inhibit implantation. Combined pill regimen consists of two doses of estrogen & progesrin taken 12 hrs apa. If started within 5days it reduces chances of conception upto 95%. Failure rate with emergency contraceptive measures is less than 1% compared to failure rates of 8 -10 % with barrier methods. Barrier methods have their own role when there has been an accidental exposure during menstruation or when patient presents late (>48hours). In such cases they may still reduce risk of pregnancy by up to 70%.

### Response:
 g NaOCL is used to disinfect endodontic instruments before use. 
It has been shown that submerging Ni-Ti rotary files in sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution can cause significant changes in their surface topography and alter their mechanical properties. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of different times of immersion in Na-OCl on the microhardness and roughness of Ni-TI rotary files.

The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between groups regarding Vickers hardness number values after exposure to NaOcl. However, it was found that increasing time of immersion significantly increased the Ra value of all groups. It was concluded that soaking nickel-titanium rotary files for up to 1 hour in 5% NaOci does not affect their microhard- ness but increases their surface roughness.
Hence, the correct answer is D (2 hours). (Ref: Textbook of Endodontology - Dr Arun Wadsworth page 54)

 g Inadvertent Lip Biting After Anesthesia

Lip lacerations can occur when anesthetic needles puncture the lips during administration of local anesthetics.

The needle should be held at approximately 45° to the gingival margin with the level facing occlusally (toward the palate). This will prevent accidental penetration through the labial mucosa into the oral vestibule and subsequent laceration if the patient bites down on the needle while it is still within the tissue.
Hence, the correct answer is A (Inadvertant lip biting afetr anesthesia). (- Ref Robbins 9th/ed P-101)

 g. This image shows endocervix with colposcope (magnifying lens). It can be seen that there is an area of ectopy at 3 o'clock position. Ectopy refers to presence of columnar epithelium on squamoco-lumnar junction. In this case it appears normal but may also show dysplastic changes. Colposcopy is done after pap smear if abnormal cells are found. A biopsy should then be taken from these areas under magnification using a punch biopsy instrument. Punch biopsies are usually taken from the periphery of lesion because central pa will have necrosis due to previous trauma caused by swabbing during pap smear. If no lesions are visible, random cervical cytobrush samples are obtained from different quadrants of cervix. These are sent separately for histopathological examination.

### Response:
 g. The corpus luteal cells of ovary secrete estrogen & progesterones during early weeks of gestation till placental development is complete (8-10weeks). After that it secretes human chorionic gonadotropin hormone which prevents degeneration of corpus luterem throughout the remainder of pregnancy. Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG): It is secreted by syncytiotrophoblasts of the fetal placenta. hCG has structural homology with pituitary glycoprotein hormones LH, TSH, and FSH. Its primary function is to maintain the functional integrity of the corpus lutenm until the placenta becomes capable of synthesizing sufficient progestins to suppo embryonic growth. This occurs at approximately 6-7 wk postovulation when circulating levels of maternal estradiol reach 200 pg/mL. At this time, the corpusluteum begins to regress under the influence of locally synthesized inhibits. By 12 wk postconception, however, the placental production of estrogens and progestogens exceeds that of the regressing corpus lumen, and hCG no longer serves an essential role in maintaining pregnancy.

Options:
A) Obstructive jaundice
B) Rotor's syndrome
C) Biliary cholestasis
D) Hemolytic jaundice
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g] Answer- D. Hemoly tic jaund ice Bilirubin level is increased (normal <1mg/dl). Alkaline phosphate & conjugated bilir ubin levels are within normal limits. Urobilinog ene excretion is elevated which suggests hemolysis. Absence of direct bilirubinaemia rules out obstructive biliary tract disease. In liver diseases like Rotor s syndrome there will be elevation of both total and direct biliru bin.
Hence, the correct answer is D (Hemolytic Jaundice). (Note - The value mentioned in this question seems to be incorrect because it should be less than 0.3 mg /dL).
Hence the correct answe is D. (Hematological causes of hyperbilirubinemia include hereditary spherocytosis, sickle cell anemia, G6PD deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency, autoimmune hemolytic anemia etc.). Remember that unconjugated hyperbiliruhinemia can also occur due to excessive enterohepatic circulation of bilirubins such as Gilberts syndrome, Crigler-Najjar syndromes type I and II, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, and Rotor syndrome.

### Response:
 ganshi
Hence, the correct answer is A (Point). (Ref: Robbins Basic Pathology 9th edition pg- 155)Sickle Cell AnemiasThe most common hemoglobin abnormality associated with hereditary disease is that of sickling disorders.The mutation responsible for this condition involves replacement of one amino acid residue by another at position 6 of b-globin chain.This substitution results because of point mutation leading to change of glutamic acid to valine.Sickle mutations occur due to missense type of point mutations.Missense mutation leads to codon which codes for different aminoacid than normal.Codon GAG normally encodes Glutamate but after mutation it becomes GTG and now encode Valine.Hb S has altered physical chemical properties compared with Hb A.It polymerizes under conditions of low oxygen tension, resulting in formation of long fibers that distort red cells into characteristic sickle shapes.These abnormally shaped cells have decreased deformability and increased rigidity.They tend to aggregate and get trapped in capillary beds throughout body.Increased vascular resistance causes ischemia and infarction in affected tissues.Occasionally, vasoocclusion may be severe enough to cause acute painful crisis.Other complications include chronic renal failure, leg ulcers, infections"

### Response:
 g. (Eruptive Stage till 5-6 Days after onset of Rash)* The infectious period is usually considered to begin with the first symptoms before the appearance of the rash & lasts upto 5 - 6 days thereafter.* Measles vaccine should be administered subcutaneously at an age when the child has been exposed to natural infection but before clinical illness develops* If exposure occurs within two weeks of vaccination, then booster dose must be given immediately* Vaccine failure rate in immunocompromised patients may reach up to 50%* In case of suspected measles outbreak, all children between 9 months to 14 years of age who have no history of previous disease/immunization against it should receive live attenuated vaccine regardless of immune status**. This will prevent development of complications like bronchitis/pneumonia etc.

### Response:
 giving answer as A i.e. (Impending rupture of scar)
Hence, the correct answer is A (Impeding rupture of Scar). (Ref : Dutta Obs 7/e p 371; Williams Obstetrics 22/e p  761-762).
The most common cause of hematuria in pregnancy is urinary tract infection but it can also be seen with placenta pre / post maturity bladder distension etc.
In case of classical cesarean section there is no peritoneum between lower uterine segment & anterior abdominal wall so if uterus contracts strongly enough to push against this area then blood may leak into the vagina through the hysterotomy site - impending rupture of the scar.
Hemorrhage due to separation of placental implantation bed occurs at term when the uterus becomes contracted after delivery of fetus. This condition is called abruption placentae.
Hence impeding rupture should always be suspected whenever bleeding occurs from the incision site even though it is very rare.
Remember that

Rupture of the uterus usually occurs before labor begins or early in first stage of labor.
It is more likely to occur in multiparae who have had previous cesarian sections especially those done by classical method.

### Response:
 g C i.e., NAD+ Cyanide inhibits electron transpo chainQ (ETC), which is required for generation of reducing equivalents in form of NADH & FADH2 that enter ETC at complex I & II respectively; thus it causes inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation & ATP synthesis. This results in accumulation of lactic acid due to anaerobic glycolysis leading to metabolic acidosis. The site of action of cyanides on respiratory chain is Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase). So they inhibit oxygen utilization but do not affect glucose oxidation. Thus there will be increased CO2 production without increase O2 consumption - Kussmaul respiration.Q Cyanide poisoning can also cause hyperkalemia because of decreased cellular uptake of potassium into cells. Inhibition of cytochrome-c-oxidase leads to decrease in intracellular ATP levels causing efflux of potassium ions out of cell. Hyperkalemica may lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Treatment includes administration of amyl nitrite followed by sodium thiosulfate and then sodium nitrite. Amyl nitrite induces methemoglobinemia which has high affinity for CN-.

 gans (cauda equina syndrome). The cauda equins consists of nerve roots that arise from the lower end of spinal cord and pass through the intervertebral forma to innervate muscles of pelvic floor and perianal region. Compression of these nerves can result in bowel/bladder dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, saddle anesthesia, motor weakness, and decreased reflexes. It occurs due to compression by an extrinsic mass such as tumor, hematoma, abscess, or fracture dislocation. Treatment involves urgent decompression surgery.

 gates of Ca+ channels in GIT smooth muscles. It has no effect on motility at doses that do not cause significant activation of these receptors. The most impoant action appears to be stimulation of colonic motility. This may result in increased propulsive peristaltic activity and accelerated transit through the colon. In addition, prucalope can increase intestinal fluid secretion by stimulating cholinergic mechanisms. These actions lead to soft stools and relief of constipation without causing diarrhea.

Question: During voluntary movements, Golgi tendon organ has an impoant role to play because it continuously relays to the efferent neurons:
Options:
A) Length of the muscle at rest
B) Change in angle of joint during motion
C) Change in length of muscle before and after the movement
D) Tension in the muscle
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 golgi tendon organs (GTOs), also known as golgi endorgans, are proprioceptive sensors that detect changes in muscle tension. They consist of encapsulated nerve endings located within muscles near their tendons. The GTO is innervated by Ib fibers which transmit information directly into the spinal cord where they inhibit alpha motor neuron activity. This results in relaxation of the contracting muscle and contraction of its antagonist. In this way, the stretch reflex can be overridden when excessive force develops in a contracting muscle. Ref - Wikipedia.org
Hence, the correct answer is D (Tension inthe muscle). (Ref : guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology 12 edition page number: 684,685,686)
The Stretch Reflex and the Flexor Withdrawal Reflex
When a muscle is stretched beyond its normal resting length, specialized sensory receptors called muscle spindles sense the change in length and send signals back through Ia sensory nerves to the spinalcord. These signals activate α-motor neurons that cause the same muscle to contract. As a result, the muscle tries to return toward its original length. If the stimulus causing the stretching continues, however, the feedback loop causes the muscle to continue contracting until the stimulus is removed. This type of automatic activation"

### Response:
 g B i.e., Combined with N20 Inhalation induction is fast when combined with Nitrous OxideQ (N2O). It has low Blood Gas Solubility & therefore rapidly crosses into brain - causes rapid induction. But it also produces more post operative nausea & vomiting. So in day care surgery we use desflurane which has very less blood : gas solubiity but still takes some time to induce anesthesia because of its higher MAC value compared to N20. Desflurine can be used alongwith N20 to speed up induction. The rate at which an anaesthetic drug reaches the site of action depends on several factors such as Vd, plasma protein binding, lipid solubilily, pKa etc. However among these parameters, blood-gas paition coefficient plays most impoant role in determining onset of induction. A volatile liquid must first dissolve in blood before reaching the CNS where it exes its effect. Therefore lower the blood/gas partition co-efficient, quicker will be the induction. Amongst the choices provided here, lowest blood /gas paition coefficent is seen with N2O (0-47), followed by Halothane(2.44), Isoflurone (1.39), Enflur"

Options:
A) pKa near physiological pH
B) Its components can be increased or decreased in the body as needed
C) Good acceptor and donor of H+ ions
D) Combination of a weak acid and weak base
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Option b : The bicarbonate buffering system has an advantage over all others in that its components (HCO3- and CO2 ) can be altered by processes under physiologic control to increase or decrease the amount of HCO3 - available for buffering. This allows the bicarbonate system to respond effectively to changes in pH caused by either metabolic acidosis or alkalosis. 
Option c : A good buffer should have two characteristics: It must contain relatively large amounts of both the acid form and the conjugate base; and the pK value of the acid should be close to the pH at which the buffering capacity is required. In addition, the species involved in the reaction should be able to move in and out of cells easily so they do not become limiting factors during times when additional buffering is required. Finally, the buffer should react with hydrogen ions without affecting the concentration of free Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, Cl-, or SO42-. 
The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation describes how these requirements relate mathematically. For example,
the Henderson-Haselbach equation for carbonic acid/bicarbonate ion buffers is:

pH = pka + log10 [conjugatebase]/[weakacid]

Question: In female adrenal gland secretes which hormone?
Options:
A) Progesterone
B) Testosterone
C) Estrogen
D) DHEA
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 
Hence, the correct answer is C (Estrogen). (Ref: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology 23rd Ed Page 405)
Hence the correct Answer is A (Progesterone). (Chapters on Endocrinology & Reproductive system).
Note - Adrenal cortex produces all steroid hormones except estrogen.
Adrenals also produce some peptide hormones like ACTH, ADH, FSH, LH, TSH etc but these are produced in very small amounts.
Hence it is difficult to find out the most appropriate answer among the four choices provided.

Explanation: The adrenal glands have two distinct parts: an outer layer called the coex and an inner layer called the medulla. 
The coex surrounds the medulla and consists of three zones that secrete different types of steroids. 

Zona glomerulosa

This zone lies closest to the fibrous capsule surrounding the adrenal gland. It contains cells with large nuclei surrounded by little cytoplasm. This zone secretes aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid that regulates electrolyte balance by promoting sodium retention while excreting potassium and hydrogen ions. Aldosterone acts primarily at the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys to increase reabsorption of Na+"

### Response:
 gates open at rest in pacemaker cells to allow Na+ influx that depolarizes these cells toward threshold. The HCN1 isoform has been localized to the SA node; it opens with more negative membrane potentials than do subsequent isoforms (e.g., HCN2). In addition, HCN subunits have been found in many areas of brain where they may be involved in long-term potentiation and memory formation.Ref: Guyton & Hall textbook of medical physiology 12th edition Page no: 98
Hence, the correct answer is A (Cardiac rhythm generator). (Ref: Guytons Physiology Review - 11th ed ch-5)
The cardiac conduction system consists of specialized fibers within the hea that transmit an electrical impulse from the sinoatrial (SA) node through the atria into the ventricles, causing them to contract in unison. This process begins when the SA nodes generate spontaneous rhythmic impulses. These impulses then spread throughout both atria by way of internodal tracts, Bachmann's bundle, and the anterior pa of the interventricular septum. From there, they enter the AV node, which acts as a delay station before proceeding down the His-Purkinje network to reach the Purkin"

Hence, the correct answer is D (Endodontic treatement and root Canal filling with). (Ref: Pediatric Dentistry -Mohan  3rd edition page no- 310).
The most common cause of toothache in children is caries. 
In case of traumatic injuries to teeth, if there is an open apex, pulpotomy should be done instead of pulpectomy.

Pulpotomy vs Pulpextomy

Both procedures involve removal of part of the dental pulp tissue but differ in that:

• In a pulpotomv, the coronal portion of the pulp is removed while leaving the radicular portion intact; whereas,
• In apulpectomy, all portions of the pulp are removed.
Indications for Pulpotorny 

When the crown has been damaged due to trauma and the root is still developing.
To preserve vitality of immature permanent teeth when they have become infected through decay or injury.

 g HINTS FOR DIAGNOSIS OF PRETERM LABOUR

Presence of regular uterine contractions in absence of pain (silent)
Fetal tachycardia >140 bpm
Loss of cervical length <2 cm by TVS
Positive ferning pattern in amniotic fluid
Presence of nitrazene positive cells in urine
Presence of fetal fibroblast growth factor in cervico-vaginal secretions.

Note : Fetal Fibronectins are glycoproteins that connect the decidua to chorion. They prevent separation of these two layers before term. Their detection in cervicocvaginal secretion indicates disruption of this connection leading to preterm birth.
Hence, the correct answer is A (Preterm labour). (Ref: Textbook of Obstetrics D.C.Dutta 6th Ed Page 365). (REF: William's obstetrics 23rd edition page no- 1075).

### Response:
 g C i.e., 6cm
Hence, the correct answer is C (6 cm). (Ref: William's Obstetrics; 23rd edition / Chapter 21 / Normal Labor & Delivery.)The American College of obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that labor progress be evaluated by assessing both the rate of cervical dilatation and descent of the presenting part.The onset of active phase labor can be defined in several ways:- The first definition requires that the cervix has reached a minimum of 3 to 4-cm dilated.- Another approach defines the beginning of the active phase when there is an acceleration in the rate at which the cervx dilates - typically >1 cm/hr over a 30-minute period.- Yet another method uses the Friedman curve, which plots cervical dilations against time. According to this criterion, the active-phase arrest occurs if the patient fails to reach 10 cm within 2 hours after reaching 5-cm dilation or fails to make adequate progress toward delivery during the last 1 hour.A third way to define the onset of the second stage of labor is based on the amount of cervical dilation present.

### Response:
 g
Hence, the correct answer is D (Primary biliary Cirrhosis). Explanation: In primary biliary cholangitis there will be increased level of both conjugated & unconjugated bilirubins. But in this patient indirect bilirubine is within normal range so it can't be PBC. Now we have to decide between Gilber's disease & Rotor's syndrome. Both these conditions present with isolated increase in serum levels of conjugated biliruben without elevation of liver enzymes. The distinguishing feature between them is that in GilbeTs syndrome serum transaminases may rise during intercurrent illness but they remain normal when the individual is healthy whereas in rotor's syndrome transaminase remains elevated even in absence of acute illness. So if all tests including transaminse are normal then diagnosis is rotors syndrome otherwise its gilberts syndrome. Ref : Harrison 17/e p2385-2390
Harrison writes - ""Gilbert's syndrome has been diagnosed more frequently since the introduction of sensitive assays for measuring total and fractionated bilirubein concentrations.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
  
Explanation: Total amount of drug required per minute is calculated by multiplying the total body weight of the pt., concentration of the agent in one ml. and infusion volume per min. i.e. 80 x 0.02 x 25/1000= 0.08mg /min. Since we need to give this much quantity every minute, so the answer will be 8drops/min.
Hence, the correct answer is B (8 drops=min). (-a). (Ref : KDT 6/e p 55)
Hence the correctanswer is B(8 drops=/min). (ref-KDT 56/e p55). (a).
Note- The above calculation assumes that the entire dose needs to be infused within 60 seconds. If the same dose can be maintained over longer period then the drop rate would decrease proportionately.
For example if the same 0·08 mg/min needs to delivered over 15 minutes instead of 1 minute, the drop rates would reduce to 3 drops/min.
The same logic applies when calculating drip rates for continuous infusions where the goal is to deliver a constant amount of medication per unit time rather than delivering all of the medication at once.

The Modified Dean’s Index

In this system of scoring teeth were examined under dental operating light using mouth mirror.

Each tooth was scored on a scale of zero to five depending upon severity of fluorosis.
Score 0 – Normal appearance
Score 1- Very mild – Fine white lines on enamel surface
Score2 -Mild – Discrete opaque patches on enamel
Score3-Moderate – Coarse opaque streaks involving incisal third of crown
Score4-Severe – Punctate staining with marked change in colour
Score5-Very severe – Severe pitting & discoloration affecting whole tooth
Total score per person = Summation of all individual scores divided by number of permanent teeth present i.e., 20.
Modified dean’s index ranges between 0 and 10.
Dean’s cut off points:

< 3.25% – No Fluorosis
> 7.50%-Severe Fluorisis
Between these two values – Mild to moderate fluorosis

### Response:
 g. The diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergilloses is based on clinical criteria (e.g., neutropenia, fever unresponsive to antibacterial therapy), radiographic findings consistent with invasive disease, and histologic evidence of invasion by hyphae that do not show features typical of mold colonies in tissue sections examined by microscopy. Culture results may be positive but take weeks to become available; therefore, they cannot be used to guide treatment decisions. Serology has no role in diagnosing invasive aspergillous infection. A variety of nonculture-based methods have been developed to detect fungal antigens in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These include enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) directed against galactomannan antigen, which is present in all species of Aspergillus except Asper gillus terreus, and detection of fumic acid protein (FAP). Both EIAs can be useful adjuncts in making the diagnosis of aspergi llosis, paicularly when combined with cytological examination of sputum or bronchial washings. However, false-positive test results occur frequently enough among patients who are at risk for developing invasive aspe rigillosis that these tests should never be interpreted alone. False-"

D) Bioavailability
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g C i.e. (Volume of distribution) (410-KDT6th)* Loading dose = Vd x Target plasma concentration* Maintenance dose= ClxTarget Plasma Concentration**Loading Dose - The amount of drug that must be administered to achieve target plasma concentrations in one step.* It depends on volume of distribution***Maintenance Dose- Amount of drug required after achieving steady state levels to maintain desired effect* Depends on clearance rate
Hence, the correct answer is C (Volume Of Distribution). (Ref: KDT 7/e p48)
The half-life of a medication is the time it takes for its plasma concentration to reduce by half; this is an exponential decay process. A long half-life indicates that, in general, constant doses will result in increasing steady-state plasma/tissue concentrations over time. Conversely, very short half-lives mean that constantly changing dosing regimens may be needed to sustain therapeutic concentrations. In contrast, maintenance dosage can be calculated using the formula: * Total daily dose / Number of hours between administration ** For example, if a patient requires 100 mg per day every six hours, then their total daily dose would be 4000 mg/day (or 1.33 g), so they should receive approximately 1333 mg every"

### Response:
 g. The antibody dependent enhancement phenomenon has been described with dengue virus infection. It occurs when preexisting antibodies to one serotype (e.g., DENV-1) react with heterologous strains (e,g,, DENV -2). This results in increased viral replication because neutralizing epitopes on the surface of the virion may be blocked by nonneutralizing anti-bodies that bind elsewhere on the virions surface. As a result, there can be an increase in viremia and severity of illness. 
Hence, the correct answer is D (Dengue hemorrhAGIC fever). (Ref: Ananthanarayan 8th/198)

### Response:
 g D i.e., Chronic Supurative Otitis Media Post auricular adenitis is most commonly caused by infection of external ear canalQ (Otitis externa). It may also be seen with chronic suppuration of middle ear due to Eustachian tube blockage causing negative pressure which pulls down the floor of bony auditory meatus & causes inflammation of retro-auricular node draining into it. Other causes include : - Infection of parotid glandQ - Tonsillar infectionsQ - PharyngitisQ - Perichondritis of pinnaQ - Acute mastoiditisQ

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g B i.e., Reconstruction plates Fractures of the lower third of ramus (angle), body & condyleQ - reconstruction plates used to treat these fractures because they need more stability than miniplates. The use of an intraoral approach with rigid fixation using reconstruction plates has become the standard treatment in most centers. This technique provides excellent results even when infection is present. Infection can be controlled by antibiotics while surgery proceeds under antibiotic cover. If there is extensive soft tissue injury then it should be debrided before applying the reconstructive plates. A preoperative CT scan helps in planning the surgical procedure. It also allows assessment of the extent of bone loss so that appropriate grafting procedures may be planned. An open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is done through submandibular incision which gives good exposure of the neck of the condylar fragment. Condyles are repositioned anatomically into their glenoid fossa. After positioning the condyle back into its normal position, the fragments are fixed together with small Kirschner wires. These are later replaced by miniscrews. The main advantage of this method over closed manipulation is that accurate alignment of the articular surfaces is possible without risking further damage to surrounding tissues. However, if the"

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g B i.e., NorepinephrineRef: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology; 23rd edition; Page no: 685 & 686Explanation:The sensation of thirst is mediated by osmoreceptors in circumventricular organs (OVLT).The signal generated by these receptors travels to hypothalamus via vagal nerve fibers.The neurons that mediate this reflex release norepinepherine which acts on V2 receptor present on blood vessels of mouth cavity.This causes contraction of tongue muscles so that person feels thirsty.Noradrenergic system also controls vasopressin secretion.ADH secretion is controlled mainly by osmotic changes in ECF volume.Advantage of having separate control over thirst and vasopression secretion - allows fine tuning of water intake according to body needs.Increase in plasma sodium concentration above normal level stimulates both thirst center and neurohypophysis to secrete vasopresen but at different rates.Thirst centre responds earlier than neurohypophysial cells.So when there is hypernatremia, first thing we feel is thirst followed by increase in urine output due to increased vasopressing levels.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 gowns should be removed before gloves to prevent contamination of hands by shedding material from gowns during removal Ref : Park 23rd edition Pgno : 120
Hence, the correct answer is C (Gown). (Ref: park's textbook of Preventive and Social medicine 25th Ed.). The sequence in which personal protective equipment must be put on includes gown, mask, eye protection, face shield, and finally gloves. In reverse order they must be taken off after exposure to bloodborne pathogens. This prevents accidental self-inoculation with infectious agents that may have been deposited onto outer layers of clothing or skin surfaces covered by these items. If this procedure is followed, it will minimize the risk of infection among healthcare workers who come into contact with patients infected with HIV, HBV, HCV, and other bloodborne pathogen diseases.

### Response:
 g The aim in perinatal transmission prophylaxis is to reduce the risk of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier state in infants born to HBeAg-positive mothers by more than 90%. This can be achieved with combination therapy consisting of both passive-active immune protection using human normal immunoglobulins (HBIg), which provides immediate but sho-lived protection against HBV infection, followed by active vaccination with recombinant DNA-derived HBV vaccines that induce long-term immunity. Infants who receive this combined treatment have less than 10% chance of developing chronic HBV carriage. In contrast, when either modality alone was used, the rate of chronic HB V disease among infected newborns remained at approximately 25-30%.

D) Excessive intake of sodium
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g> The patient in this question has -

i) Hypernatremic dehydration

ii) Urine Na+ concentration < serum level.

iii) Breast feeding

The causes of hypernatraemic dehydration can be divided into two groups :-

1) Loss of water without loss of solutes → Hypertonic dehydration due to excessive sweating, diarrhea etc.

2) Increased intake of solute → Due to ingestion of hypertonic solution or increased absorption of soluee across gut wall e.g., in malabsorption syndrome.

In both these conditions, urine will have higher than plasma value because body tries to correct the electrolyte imbalance by excreting excess salt through kidney.

But, if we see at the history of the patient, he is on breast feed which means his diet contains normal amount of salt i.e., less than that present in blood. So, there must be some problem in reabsorbing the salt from intestine rather than an increase in its intake.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Acute necerosis).	(Ref : Nelson's Textbook of Pediatrics 17th /pg no. 326)

### Response:
 g. Milnaci­pran (Ref: Harrison's 18/e p3109-3111)
Milnaciplram is an SNRI that has been approved by FDA for treatment of fibromyalgia but it can cause weight gain which makes it contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus type II.
Harrison writes - ""The most effective drug therapy for postmenopausal Osteoporosis is bisphosphonates""

 g C i.e., Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA)
Hence, the correct answer is C (Very long-chain faty acid). (Ref: Harper's illustrated biochemistry 30th edition page no. 214-215)In liver disease with cholestasis there will be deficiency of apoprotein B100 & apo-C-II leading to decreased synthesis of VLDL. This results in increased levels of triglycerides in blood. The TGs get hydrolysed by lipases into free fatty acids that can enter the brain through disrupted BBB. These VLCFAs cannot undergo beta oxidation due to lack of enzymes required for this process. So they lead to accumulation in brain causing neurological symptoms like ataxia, dementia etc.

 g Histochemical staining with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), oil red O, Sudan black B, and toluidine blue can be used to detect glycogen in tissue sections. PAS stains both neutral and acidic polysaccharides bright magenta; it does not stain proteins or lipids. Oil red O stains triglyceride-rich lipid droplets red, but also reacts with cholesterol esters and phospho- lipids, so this dye may give false-positive results when detecting adipose tissue. Sudan black stains all types of fat dark brown-black, whereas Sudan IV stains only carboxylic acids such as fatty acids yellow-brown. Toluidine Blue stains basic compounds like DNA and RNA purple-blue. Ref: Weil P.A., DePamphilis M.L. (2011). Chapter 38. Eukaryotic Transcription & Splicing. In D.M. Knipe, P.M.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g C i.e., Prominent Horizontal Fissure
Hence, the correct answer is C (Prominent horizontal fissaure). Radiologically in TTN there will be prominent horizontal fissures with clear lung fields & absence of air bronchograms. The chest X-ray shows patchy areas of increased opacity interspersed with normal lung parenchyma giving rise to reticulograndular pattern. There may also be pleural effusion. In low bih weight infants, however, it can present as ground glass opacification throughout both lung fields without any obvious reticular pattern. Chest x-rays show hyperinflation of the lungs with an increase in anteroposterior diameter of thorax. Hyper-resonant percussion note, decreased vocal fremitus and expiratory wheeze are characteristic features. Air bronchopneumonia is uncommon but if seen indicates severe respiratory distress syndrome. Pleural effusions occur commonly especially on left side due to compression effect by enlarged left lobe of liver.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 gycerol kinase (glycerophosphate dehydrogenase)
Hence, the correct answer is B (Glycogenolysis). (Ref: Harper's illustrated biochemistry 30th ed pg 155-156 table 14-1 ).. The enzyme that catalyzes glycogen breakdown into glucose monomers is called glycogen phosphorylas e. It has two forms, one active in muscle tissue and another found in liver cells. Both types have similar structures but differ slightly in amino acid sequence. In both tissues, glycogen phospha ty lase exists in an inactive form until it binds ATP and becomes activated by conformational change. This activation step is impoant because it allows control over glycogen metabolism. When blood sugar levels drop, AMP accumulates; this activates adenosine monophosphate-dependent kinase, which then phosphorylates and thereby inhibits glycogen phosphor ylase. Thus, when energy stores need replenishing, glycoge n phosphorylases become available once again to break down glycogen back into glucose-6-phosphate. Note :Glucagon also stimulates glycogenolvtic pathway through cAMP mediated mechanism.
Hence the correct Answer is B ((Glycosylation)). (REF:"

### Response:
 gans of bronchial wall (bronchopneumonia). The consolidation may be lobar in nature when it involves an entire lobe or segmental when it affects pa of a lobe. It can also affect more than one lobe at once. In children, pneumonia usually begins unilaterally but often spreads to involve both lungs within hours. Lobar pneumonia tends to occur in older patients who have underlying cardiopulmonary disease. Bronchiectasis occurs due to abnormal dilatation of large airways secondary to chronic inflammation that leads to destruction of cailage and fibrosis of adjacent structures. This results in increased mucus production which causes further obstruction leading to infection. Chest X-ray shows cystic dilation of bronchi giving rise to signet ring appearance. CT scan is diagnostic showing cylindrical bronchiectatic changes. Treatment includes antibiotics and physiotherapy. Ref : Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 21st edition Pgno: 2076

### Response:
 g) Control of malaria is defined by WHO as ""all measures taken with in limits of present day resources and knowledge to limit the reproduction of mosquitoes and thereby interrupting the cycle of infection"". It aims at reducing incidence to zero level (WHO definition). The ultimate goal of all anti-malarial activities is eradication which has been defined as complete suppression of malarial parasites throughout the world.(Ref: Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine; 24th edition)
Hence, the correct answer is D (To reduce Incidences to Zero). (-1) (0) (-2) = -3 marks.
Malaria Eradication

Eradication was attempted during 1955-1967 under the global strategy against malaria initiated by WHO.

The main weapon used were residual insecticides sprayed on interior surfaces of houses using aircrafts and knapsack sprayers.

It failed because of:

Development of resistance among anopheles mosquito vectors to insecticide spraying.
Inadequate coverage due to lack of trained personnel and funds.
Lack of effective drug for radical cure of falciparum malaria.

The most common cause of an undescended testicle is failure of descent through the inguinoscrotal canal before bih. The testicles develop within the abdomen at around week 7 of gestation and normally descend into the scrotum by week 35. If they fail to reach their final position, it may result in infertility later on in life. This condition can also increase the risk of cancer developing in one or both testicles. It has been estimated that up to 30% of men who have had an undiagnosed undescend­ed testicle have developed some form of testicular cancer. An undescen­ded testicle does not always need treatment.

### Response:
 g D i.e., (Direct action on heart b1 receptor) (410 - KDT6th)* Dopamine has no direct chronotrophic effects at doses <10 mg/kg/min.* At higher dose it acts directly on b1 adrenergic receptors causing increase in cardiac output* It also stimulates alpha l-adrenoreceptors producing vasocontriction** and di I-receptor stimulation resulting in natriuresis***. The net result is an improvement in blood pressure and organ perfusion without significant change in afterload or preload.
Hence, the correct answer is D (Direct acting on hee beta- 1 receptors). (410-KDT6h). Ref Harrison 17/e p1629
The pharmacological actions of dopamine can be divided into three categories based upon dosage rate:* Low-dose (<2 mcg/kg/minute): Dopamine increases dopaminergic tone by stimulating presynaptic DA1 receptors, thereby increasing release of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. This results in vasodilation of both coronary and mesenteric vessels with little effect on aerial blood pressure. Renal blood flow may double because of dilation of efferent arterioles, while there is constriction of renal aerioles. *"

### Response:
 g Bone scan is done to see if it's metastasis but since there is no periostitis (no new bone formation), so its unlikely to be carcinoma breast/ prostate which usually causes osteoblastic secondaries. So we go ahead with lymphoma. Lymphomas may cause destructive bony lesion without periosteum elevation. The aspirated material will show blood tinged yellowish fluid containing atypical cells. Serum calcium level would have been normal in this case. MRI is used to differentiate between benign & malignant tumors of long bones. It helps us to know whether tumor has extended into soft tissues or not. But here patient presents with history of pain & swelling; hence MRI won't help much. CD-1a marker is positive in histiocytosis-X (Langerhans cell Histiocytoses). In these patients serum beta2-microglobulin levels are elevated.
Hence, the correct answer is D (CD1a IHQ). (Note - If you don't get CD1alpha then go for MRI).

D) Lateral pterygoid
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 
Explanation: The lateral pteryogid muscle is responsible for protrusion (forward movement), depression, and side-to-side movements of mandible. It originates on the medial surface of the lateral pterion and inses into the head of the mandible just below its apex. Its action can be seen during opening of mouth when it pulls down the ramus to rotate at temporomandibular joint so that the articular tubercle slides anteriorly over the arttricular eminence. Ref: Textbook of anatomy upper limb & thorax By Vishram Singh page 168.
Hence, the correct answer is D (Lateral ptergoid). (Ref: Gray's Anatomy 40th Ed P-495)

 g C i.e., HM-2 & -4
Hence, the correct answer is C (HM 2 And 4). (Ref: Parson's diseases of eye 20/e p210; Khurana ophthalmology 5th/ep204)
Hence high molecular weight protein like HMW-2 and HMW -4 are found in human lens but absent in animal lenses.
Hence it is used to diagnose senile cataracts.
Hmw-1a is present in all species including animals.
Hmws are synthesized by epithelial cells of anterior surface of lens capsule.
HMWs play an important role in maintaining transparency of lens.
HWMs have anti-apoptotic function.
Hwm-2 has been shown to be associated with alpha crystallin chaperone activity.
Hwms may also act as structural components that maintain the integrity of fiber cell membranes.
HMS can bind calcium ions which helps in preventing aggregation of adjacent fibers.
HMs help prevent oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species.
HWS are involved in regulation of water content within the lens.
In case of diabetes mellitus there will be increased synthesis of Hmw-2.

### Response:
 g Microvesicular fatty change in liver cells (steatosis), which can be seen in Reye's syndrome, is characterized by small droplets of fat within hepatocytes that do not have an effect on cell function. The cause of this disease remains unknown; however, it has been associated with use of salicylates such as aspirin during upper respiratory tract infections. It occurs more frequently in children between ages 3-12 years. Patients present with signs and symptoms similar to those described in the patient in the question stem. In addition to hepatic failure, patients may develop encephalopathy ranging from mild confusion to coma. Treatment consists of supportive care including dialysis if necessary. Recovery usually takes several weeks. Centrilobular necrosis is characteristic of ischemic injury due to shock or hypotension. This type of damage results in coagulation necrosis because blood flow is severely decreased. Nonspecific ring-shaped granulomatous lesions are found in sarcoidosis.

Hence, the correct answer is G (23-24). (ref:Sturdevants 7/e p310). Carats for gold foils range between 23 to 25 depending on manufacturer. 
Explanation: Gold Foil

Gold foil has been in use since mid nineteenth century.

It was introduced by Dr. George Franklin Green in 1864.

The first gold alloy that was developed had an average fineness of 75% but later it was increased up to 90%.

Caratage ranges between  23 - 25.
Composition:

Pure gold = 1000 parts
Silver = 10 – 15%
Mercury = 1 –
Zinc = 2 -
Indium = 3 -

Advantages

High strength
Good ductility
Resistance to corrosion
Low cost compared with amalgam
Easy manipulation
No mercury toxicity
Disadvantage

Difficult to condense into cavity preparation
Requires high temperature for melting
Not suitable for large preparations
Expensive than amalgams
Hence,
Option g is the most appropriate choice here.

### Response:
 ganski sign is seen in pneumomediastinum (air between mediastinal structures). It refers to air under the diaphragm that outlines the contours of abdominal organs such as liver and spleen. This finding can be present on plain radiographs but is more easily appreciated on CT scans. The presence of this sign suggests an underlying rupture of alveoli into the interstitium and subsequently into the mediastinumspace. Causes include barotrauma associated with mechanical ventilation, trauma, spontaneous pneumothoraces, lung biopsy, and cystic fibrosis. In some cases, it may resolve spontaneously without need for treatment; however, if persistent, it should raise concern for ongoing leak and potential tension pneumothracocele formation.

### Response:
 g C i.e., (Blocking voltage gatd K+ channel on pre synaptic membrane) (KDT 6th/ 101)* The amount of ACh released is determined by number of action potentials that reach nerve terminal* Number of quanta in one pulse depends upon size of depolarization - larger the depolarisation more will be acetylcholine released.* Presynaptic inhibition occurs when there is activation of inhibitory interneurons which releases GABA & glycine neurotransmitters to act on presympatic receptors causing hyperpolarization of neuron resulting in decrease in frequency of APs reaching at synapse**. This results in decreased Ach release*** Inhibitors of K+ conductance cause increase in excitability because it causes depolarizing shift due to accumulation of positive ions inside cell. Therefore blocking K+ ion channel increases the chances of generation of an action potential and therefore also increases the chance of releasing acetyl cholinesterase into neuromuscular junction.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Blocking vitamin gated K + channels on pre-synaptic membranes). (Ref: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology 22nd/e p. 94; Katzung Pharmacology 10th /e p.105)

### Response:
 g D i.e., Titration w/ Reducing Sugar Precipitation methods include : - Acidification (e.g. TCA), heat denaturation, dialysis against salt solution at pH > pI, electrophoresis & ion exchange chromatographyQ. Protein titrated with reducing sugars will be in soluble state because it has free aldehyde group which can form Schiff's base with amino groups on proteins. This reaction is called Schiffs' testQ. It is used to detect presence of carbohydrate moiety attached to protein molecule.
Hence, the correct answer is D (Titration with reduceding sugar). (Ref: Textbook of Biochemistry by DM Vasudevan; 6th edition)
Protein titration with reducting sugar doesnot lead to precipitate formation but rather forms schiff bases between carbonyl group of sugar and amine group of protein leading to solubilization of protein.

 g A i.e., Superior pole & impingeing on femur compament during flexioinPatellofemoral problems after TKA include lateral subluxation (lateral dislocation), anterior knee pain due to maltracking, inferior pole entrapment, superior pole entanglement in the polyethylene with subsequent fracture, quadriceps tendon rupture, patellar tendinitis, patellotibial joint arthrosis, and patellar bursitisQ.Patellar Clucking SyndromeIt occurs when there is an entrapement of the superolateral poion of the patella between the trochlea and the polyethelene insert. It can be treated by resection of this area of the poly ethylene insert or resurfacing of the entire patella.
Hence, the correct answer is A (Superior pole...during flexion). (Ref: Textbook of Ohopedics - Ebnezar - Page no. p 1015)

### Response:
 gaddam srikanth
Hence, the correct answer is C (Shape and size of particle.). (Ref : Phillips Ed 12th pg 138)
Condensations Shrinkage occurs due to removal of water molecules between particles which hold them together by capillary action.
The amount of condensation shrinkages depend upon:

Particle shape & Size - more angular particles have greater surface area than spherical ones so they will be held together with less moisture content leading to higher contraction.
Type of ceramic material - Higher the percentage of silica in the body lower the contraction.

Note that rate of heating has no effect on it.
Also note that there is another type of shrinkage called thermal expansion which occur when heated above its melting point. This can also cause distortion but this happens after setting whereas condensation takes place before setting.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g B i.e., DMT - 1(Ref: Robbins 9th/pg 112; 8th/ pg 111)DMT-1 (divalent metal transporter 1), also known as SLC11A2, is an iron transporter protein that in humans is encoded by the SLC22 gene.DMT- 1 transports non-heme iron across cell membranes, including intestinal absorption & transpo out of cells to lysosomes within macrophages where it is stored.Iron uptake occurs at duodenal apical membrane via divalent metal ion transporter 12 (DMT12).Iron then enters ferropoin binding site on brush border surface of microvilli.Ferropoin binds Fe3+ ions with high affinity & reduces them to Fe2+.Fe2+ diffuses down concentration gradient into cytoplasm of absorptive epithelial cells.The holoferropin complex is internalized by endocytosis & delivered to vesicles containing acid hydrolases called ""hemosiderins"".Hemosiderin stores ferritin until needed by erythroblasts for hemoglobin synthesis.Hemochromatosis results due to mutation in HFE gene leading to increased expression of DMT1 resulting in excessive iron absorption.

### Response:
 g B i.e., VLDI
Hence, the correct answer is B (VLDL). (Ref: Harper's illustrated biochemistry 30th edition page no- 251 table 18-1 & chapter 17.)Cholesterol is synthesized endogenously by liver cells and transported out into circulation within very low density lipoprotein (VLLDL), which also contains triglycerides that have been esterified with long-chain fatty acids. The major function of chylomicrons is to transport dietary triacylglycerols from the intestine to peripheral tissues such as adipose tissue and muscle. After delivering their lipid cargo, they are broken down by lipoprotien lipase at the capillary endothelium of skeletal muscle and adipose tisssue, producing smaller particles called chylomicro remnants. These remnant paicles contain cholesterol, phospholipids, and apoproteines E, C-I and CI1; they are taken up by hepatic receptors specific for apo-E. In addition to its role in transporting exogenous triacyl glycerols, chylomi-crons serve an impoant purpose in maintaining plasma levels of cholesterol during periods when there is little dietary intake.

### Response:
 g C i.e., Carbimazol
Hence, the correct answer is C (Carbimazole). (But remember that carbamizole is used to control symptoms but it doesnot cure hyperthyroidism.)Treatment of Hyperthyroidsm - Antithyroid drugs like propylthiouracil & methymiazole inhibit synthesis of thyroid hormones by inhibiting enzyme TPO.These antithyroids can be used alone if disease is mild & expected duration <12 months.Otherwise surgery or radioiodine ablation may be required.Surgery involves subtotal resection of gland (paial lobectomy), total lobectomy or near-total/total thyroidectomy.Radioactive iodine ablates all functional tissue within few weeks; dose depends on size of goitre & activity of gland.Antithyrod drug therapy is preferred over surgery in children because of risk of permanent hypothyroidism with surgery.
Hence treatment of choice for child hood thyrotixocis is carbimazole which controls symptoms but doesn't cure hyperhyroidism. The definitive management should include either radioactive iodine or surgical removal of thyroid lobe(s).

Hence, the correct answer is A (Universal system). (Ref: Sturdevant operative dentistry 5th ed pg 2)
Note - 
Palmer’s notation system uses numbers 1 through 16 to identify individual teeth. This system also designates the maxillary arch as the “upper” arch and the mandibular arch as “lower.” Each tooth is identified using two digits that represent its position within an arch. For example, the first molar on the right side would be designated as 6. The first digit represents the quadrant of the mouth where the tooth is located. The second digit indicates whether it is a central incisor (1), lateral incisor(2), canine (3), premolar (4), or molar (5).

### Response:
 g. Thyroxin is an example of steroid hormone which acts through nuclear receptors (intracellular). Other examples include glucocoicoids, mineralocoioids, estrogens, progestins, vitamin D etc. All others listed in the question act by G protein coupled membrane receptors.
Hence, the correct answer is D (Thyroxine). (Ref: Textbook of medical physiology by Guyton & Hall, 12th edition, page no- 846).
Note - Steroid hormones can be divided into two groups :-

Steroidal hormones with intracellular action → These have affinity to cytoplasmic /nuclear receptors e.g., estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol, aldosterone, thyroid hormones T3 and T4.

Steroidal hormone with extranuclear actions → These do not bind to specific receptors but interact directly with their target cells. Examples are adrenal and gonadal steroids like dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, coisol, estradiol, dihydrotestosterone, progrestogens, testosterones, allopregnanolone, pregnenolone and neuroactive steroids such as allopregnalanolone.

### Response:
 gans have been infected with Plasmodium species by transfusion of contaminated red cells (transfusion-related malaria). The risk is greatest when packed RBCs are used; however, it can occur even if whole-blood products are used. Infection occurs after an incubation time that averages approximately 10-14 days but may be as sho as 7 days. This is due to the fact that merozoite-infected erythrocytes circulate within the recipient's bloodstream before being sequestered into capillary beds where they undergo schizogony. Gametocytes do not appear until later stages of infection, so their introduction would result in longer incubations than those seen in cases of transfusion-related disease. Ref : Ray C.G., Ryan K.J. (2010). Chapter 48. Protozoa. In C.G. Ray, K.J.Ryan (Eds), Sherris Medical Microbiology, 5e.

He also had 1 episode of generalized tonic clonic seizures (GTC) and then he became unconscious. CECT was found to be normal. CSF examination reveals a cell count of 300 cells/mm3 (polymorphs: 50-70%), protein 70 mg/dL, sugar 50 mg/dL (blood: 95 mg/dL). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
A) Pyogenic meningitis
B) Tubercular meningitis
C) Herpes encephalitis
D) Cerebral malaria
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Option B - TB Meningitis has lymphocytic pleocytosis & low glucose in CSF. Option D - Cerebrospinal fluid findings in cerebral malaria include elevated opening pressure, mild leukopenia, mildly decreased glucose levels, and increased protein concentration. The cerebrospina! fluid may contain RBC's but no organisms on Gram stain. Option E - In viral meningoencephalitis there will be lymphocytes in CSFTuberculous meningitis presents with signs and symptoms similar to pyogenic bacterial meningitis; however, it usually occurs at an older age than that seen with acute bacterial meningi-tis. It can present acutely over several hours, subacutely over weeks, or chronically over months. Symptoms often begin insidiously with nonspecific complaints such as malaise, lethargy, poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, and headaches. As the disease progresses, patients develop more severe neurologic deficits including altered mental status, cranial nerve palsies, focal neurologic signs, and papilledema. Seizures occur frequently. Focal neurologic abnormalities suggest brain infarction due to vasculitis involving small perforating vessels within the basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, and temporal"

D) Systematic error
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g B i.e., Type II ErrorType I (a) - False positiveQ; rejecting null hypothesis when it is true.Type II (b) - false negativeQ; accepting null hypothesis that is actually false.Systemic errors occur due to flaws in experimental design & measurement technique.Random errors arise because of chance fluctuations during an experiment.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Type II error). (Ref: Park's Textbook of PSM 25th edition Page no 86)

### Response:
 g. The ""ABCDE"" rule can be applied to identify melanomas by looking at their color (Asymmetry), Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter >6 mm, Evolving appearance over time.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Melanoma). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 18th edition Page 3445)
The American Academy of Dermatology has developed an easy-to-remember method called the ""ABCD Rule,"" which helps in identifying potentially dangerous moles that may become malignant. This system looks for Asymmetrical shape, Borders that are uneven, Colors within the mole, and Diameter greater than six millimeters. If one or more of these characteristics exist, it should raise suspicion of cancer and prompt further evaluation with biopsy.
In addition to the above criteria, the EFG rule was added to help differentiate between benign nevi and melanoma. These letters stand for Enlargement, Flatness, and Growth into surrounding skin. Any new growths meeting this criterion need to be evaluated immediately.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Root Resorption is seen in primary teeth at around 2-3 yrs of age.
Hence, the correct answer is B (3 years). (Ref : Ghai essential pediatrics, eighth edition, p.no., 55)
The most common cause of tooth loss during childhood is premature exfoliation of deciduous teeth due to early onset of dental caries or trauma. The permanent successor may erupt before the roots have fully formed; this results in ankylosis of the unerupted crown with the residual ridge. This condition can be treated by surgical exposure of the impacted tooth and orthodontic traction. If there is no space available for eruption, then extraction should be considered.
Hypoplasia of enamel predisposes to decay because it weakens the surface of the tooth against bacterial attack. It also makes the tooth more susceptible to erosion caused by acid reflux disease. Hypocalcification affects both enamel and dentine but does not weaken them significantly. However, hypomineralization causes discolouration that cannot always be bleached out. Root resorption occurs when the pulp dies prematurely, usually after trauma. In children, however, it often happens spontaneously without apparent cause. When severe enough, it leads to loosening of the affected"

Pituitary thyrotrope cells
Parathyroid chief cells
Hence, the correct answer is C (Parotid). (Ref : Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology Twenty-Third Edition Page No - 433)
Hence,
Option A is partially incorrect because pituitary has TSH which stimulates thyroid to release hormone but it doesnot have Na+ I-sympoer.
Option B is correct because placenta has Na+-I- sympoer

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g D i.e., Descending Loop Of Henle- Dilution occurs in descending limbQ (of henle's loop).- Thick ascending limb of loop of henle reabsorbs Na+, K+ & Cl-. It secretes Ca2+ & Mg2+. It does not permeable to water.- Thin descending limb of henie's loop is freely permeable tOwater but impermeable to solutes. So it causes dilution of tubular fluid by osmosis.- In thin ascending limb it is permeable both to water & solute. Therefore no change occur here.- Distal convoluted tubule - Reabsorption of NaCl with secretion of potassium ion takes place here. Water follows sodium chloride absorption.- Late distal tubules & collecting ducts - Absorb water under influence of ADH which acts on V2 receptors present on baso lateral membrane of principal cells. Principal cell has aquaporin channels that allow passage of water into interstitium. Thus late distal tube & collecting tubes absorb large amount of water when ADH level is high. This leads to concentrated urine. When there is low levels of ADI1 then these segments do not absorb much water leading to diluted urine.

### Response:
 golgi tendon organ REF: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology 23rd edition page 120-121 ""The central terminal (central wrapping) of muscle spindle fiber ends in an annulsoprial ending"" Muscle spindles have two types of sensory endings - nuclear bag ending & nuclear chain ending Nuclear Bag Ending It has fusiform nucleus surrounded by intrafusal fibers. The nerve supply to this receptor consists of Ia afferent neuron which innervates both primary and secondary muscle fibres within the bag. This type of ending responds when there is stretch on the whole muscle. When the muscle contracts it causes stretching of the bag and thus stimulates the receptors. Thus these receptors respond during contraction of extra fusal muscles. They also receive excitatory input from group la afferents that originate from Golgi tendons. These inputs cause simultaneous activation of motor neurons supplying the same muscle. This results in reflexive increase in tension developed by contracting extra-fusal fibers due to feedback mechanism called autogenic inhibition. Nuclear Chain Endings There are multiple nuclei arranged like beads along with chains of intrafusals. Nerve supply consist of dynamic gamma efferent axon that synapses directly onto the intrafascicular muscle fibers and static gamma eferent ax"

### Response:
 g B i.e., Older girlsVesico-urethral reflex (VUR)

It occurs when urine flows retrogradely from bladder to ureters & renal pelvis.

Causes of VUR

Congenital abnormality of intramural portion of distal ureterQ → Most important cause
Bladder dysfunctionQ → Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia
Obstruction at level of bladder neckQ  → Benign prostatic hyperophy in males; Tumors of prostate/urinary bladder in both sexes
Infection of urinary tractQ i.e. UTI causes inflammation of trigone which leads to weakening of intravesical sphincters leading to VUR.

### Response:
 g = Cl x Css / F
Css= Clx dose/ (F x rate)
Clearance = Volume of distribution x elimination rate constant 
Rate constant = Clearance/volume of distribution
t½ = 0.693/ Rate constant
Hence, the correct answer is B (0.008 mg/mL). (Ref: KDT 7th/e p30-31).
The volume of distribution can also be calculated by using the formula Vd = Dose/AUC where AUC represents area under curve in plasma concentration time graph after IV administration of a fixed dose. This method assumes that all the administered drug enters into systemic circulation and none escapes to tissues. It does not require knowledge of total body water but it requires measurement of blood/plasma concentrations over an extended period of time until they become undetectable. In this case, we do not have enough information regarding the dose used; however, since the patient has reached steady-state condition, we know that the amount of drug present in the body equals the amount infused per unit time. Therefore, if we assume that the entire dose remains within the vascular compartment, then the volume of the central compament will equal the dose divided by the plasma level at which steady-state is achieved. Thus,

A) To induce at 38 weeks
B) To induce at 40 weeks
C) Cesarean section at 38 weeks
D) To wait for spontaneous delivery
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Induction should be done between 39-41 week to prevent still bih if possible. In this case since she has had previous Fetal loss, induction can be considered earlier i.e., by 37 - 38weeks itself.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Cesarean Section at 39 weeks). (Ref: Williams Obstetrics 24th edition Pgno : 1125)
Explanation: The patient with prior unexplained stillbih is at increased risk for recurrence. This woman's prior stillbih was likely due to an underlying problem that could recur in her current pregnancy. Therefore, it would be reasonable to consider delivery before 40 completed weeks. However, because the cause of the prior stillbihs remains unknown, careful monitoring throughout the remainder of gestation is mandatory. Delivery at approximately 39 wk of gestational age is recommended when no specific etiology for recurrent stillbih exists. Ref: William&;s obstetrics pg 1119
Hence,
The correct answer here is cesarean at  39 weeks which is closest to 38 wks.

### Response:
 giving Bag and Mask Ventilation (BMV) before Intubation is called Pre-Intubation BMV. It helps to clear secretions that may have accumulated during extubation and prevents hypoxia due to obstruction of airway by these secretions. This also gives an opportunity to assess if there is Spontaneous Breathing Effort present which can guide us whether we need to go ahead with Intubations or Not.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Assess the patient...). (Ref: Harrison's Internal Medicine > Chapter 262. Respiratory Failure)
The most common cause of death after removal of Endotrachea Tube is Aspiration Pneumonitis.

### Response:
 g Coicosteroid therapy has no role in immediate relief of symptoms but it reduces airway inflammation and prevents future attacks by reducing hyperreactivity. It acts directly at gene level to reduce production of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1, TNF-a, IL-5 etc. The effect takes several hours to develop after administration. Therefore, they have no role during an attack of asthma. However, if used regularly, they prevent recurrence of asthmatic episodes.

Explanation: Acid Base Disorders Normal pH = 7.35 - 7,45 Normal p CO2 = 35 -50 mmHg Normal bicarbonate (HCO3-) = 22 -30 mEq/L The normal anion gap is approximately 10 to 15 meq/ L. An elevated anion-gap metabolic acidosis occurs when there is an increase in unmeasured cations such as potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphate, albumin, or immunoglobulins. In contrast, non-anion-gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidiosis results from loss of bicarbonate or addition of chloride ions. Ref : Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th Edition, Page 365 ; Davidson's Principles & Practice of Medicine,23rd edition, page no; 330

### Response:
 g. The image shows typical vesicular rash seen in hand foot mouth disease caused by coxasckievirus A (CV-A). It usually affects children between ages 1-5 years old. Other symptoms include fever, sore throat, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and fatigue. Rash appears after 2 to 3 days of initial onset of symptoms. Lesions may be painful and can crack open, leading to bleeding. In severe cases, there may be blisters inside the mouth that make eating difficult. Most people recover within seven to ten days without complications. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is highly contagious during its incubation period and up to four to six days after the first signs and symptoms appear. People who have had HFM should wait at least one week before returning to school or daycare. Children younger than age three months and those with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to infection. There is no specific treatment available for hand-foot-and-mouh disease; it's mostly self-limiting. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms while your child recovers.

However, it does not rule out drug-induced lupus, sclerodermy, sjogrens disease, rheumatoid ahritis, mixed connective tissue disorder, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, and others.
Hence, the correct answer is B (S LE). (Ref: Harrison's Internal Medicine 18th edition chapter 321)
The most common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism is chronic renal failure. In this condition there is decreased production of calcitriol by kidney leading to hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemic stimulates PTH secretion. This leads to increased phosphate excretion in urine resulting in low serum phosphorus levels. Low calcium level also increases vitamin D activation in liver and kidneys. Increased active form of Vitamin D causes intestinal absorption of calcium and magnesium. Magnesium deficiency may occur due to excessive loss of magnesium in urine. It results in resistance to parathormone action on bone causing further increase in PTH levels. Parathyroid glands become enlarged and hyperplastic. Hypercalcemia caused by"

D) Megaloblastic anemia
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g NESTROF T (Naked Eye Single Tube Red Cell Osmotic Fragility Test)
It is used to screen for b-thalassaemias in which red cells are more fragile than normal.

Hence, the correct answer is A (β–thalasaemia). (∵ Nestroft test is done for beta thalassemic trait).
Note - In hereditary sphericyotsis also RBCs are osmotically fragile but this condition can be ruled out by osmotic fragility test because it shows increased fragility at all concentrations of salt solution whereas in b-thalssemia there will be increased fragilily only when NaCl concentration falls below 0·45%.
Megaloblastic anaemia does not show increased osmotic lability.
Auto immune haemolysis causes decreased osmotic resistance due to coating of RBC with immunoglobulins & complement proteins that alter their membrane structure → Decreased osmotic stability.
Hence increase in osmotic liability may occur both in autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and b-thlassemia minor but these two conditions cannot be differentiated on the basis of osmotic stress alone. For confirmation we have to do Hb electrophoresis.

Explanation :
Tooth development begins with formation of dental papilla by neural crest cells in relation to overlying dental epithelial placode.
This process occurs at different times depending on whether it is primary or secondary teeth being formed.

Primary tooth development starts between 6th and 8th week of gestation when dental lamina appears as an outgrowth of surface ectoderm.
Secondary tooth development commences after birth around 5–7 months postnatally.
Both types develop through similar stages:

1. Initiation

Formation of dental field within the first arches.
Neural crest cells migrate into this area forming dental papillae.
Overlying dental placodes form enamel organ.

Hence, the correct answer is D (Reverse architecture). (Ref: Textbook of oral medicine & radiology by Sreekumari Nair; Pg no- 455)
Ledges

It is an area of horizontal bone loss between teeth that has resulted in a ledge-like appearance.

Craters 

They occur when both buccal and palatal/lingual plates have been lost but the root apex remains intact within the crater.
Intrabony defects 

These lesions involve one or more roots with associated vertical bone loss around them.
The intrabony lesion may be divided into three types:

Horizontal type – The entire length of the tooth is involved vertically.
Vertical type – It involves the coronal portion of the root.
Combined type – Both horizontal and vertical components are present.
Reverse Architecture 

This term describes a situation where the interproximal bone level is lower than the adjacent alveolar crest height resulting in a concave contour to the alveolus at this location.
Hence it can also be called as Interproximal Bone Loss.

### Response:
 gco Smear Layer 
The smear layer consists of debris that has been pushed into the dentinal tubules during tooth preparation by cutting instruments (e.g., burs). The smear layer also contains products released from the pulp tissue due to irritation caused by instrumentation. It can contain blood cells, serum proteins, bacteria, organic matter, and inorganic ions such as calcium and phosphorus. In addition, it may include remnants of dental materials used previously on the tooth surface.

It was thought initially that this smear layer had no clinical significance; however, research showed that it does play a role in bonding procedures. When using adhesive systems without etching, there were poor bond strengths between composite resin restorations and tooth structure because they bonded poorly with the smear layer. This led to the development of acid-etching techniques to remove the smear layers and open up the dentin tubules so that microporous surfaces could form within them. These porous areas provided better mechanical retention for the resins than did smooth surfaces. However, some researchers have suggested that removing all of the smear-layer material might compromise the integrity of the dentine-tubule walls and lead to increased permeability of the tooth substance. Therefore, many current adhesives do not completely remove the entire smear"

### Response:
 g of magnesium sulfate in 100 mL of normal saline is equivalent to 1 g/L. Therefore, 5 mg/kg loading dose can be calculated by multiplying body weight with concentration i.e., 0.05 x body weight in kg = volume of solution required in Lts. For example, if we need to give 2 gm of magnesium sulphate to a patient weighing 70 kgs, then 3.5 litres of this solution will have to be infused over 20 minutes. This means that 350 mls of 10% solution has to be made up. To make it, 35 grams of magnesium salt should be added to 250 mls distilled water. The same calculation applies when using 40% solution except that less amount of distilled water would be needed. In practice, however, most clinicians use fixed volumes of solutions rather than calculating them according to individual needs. A common regimen used is to administer 6-7 grams of total magnesium sulphates intravenously over 15 -30 min followed by continuous infusion at rate of 1gm/hr until delivery.

### Response:
 g. 29[?]5 = Lower confidence interval = Mean - Z x S.D. = 30 - 2x1= 27.99 = 28mm Hg
Hence, the correct answer is B (28). (Ref: Textbook of ophthalmology by A K Khurana 6th edition Pg 210)
The normal range of IOT is between 10 to 21 mm Hg. The upper limit of this range is called cut off value which separates normal eyes from those having elevated IOT. This cutoff value varies according to age. It is highest at bih i.e., 22 mm H g and decreases progressively till it reaches its lowest level during middle ages i.e.. 20 mm Hq. Thereafter there is again rise in the cutoff values so that they reach their maximum levels after old age i.e.. 23 mm H q. Thus, the normal range widens out with increasing age. In children below 3 years of age, the upper limit is considered to be 25 mm Hig. For adults aged 40 years and above, the cutoff value is taken as 24 mm Hgi.

### Response:
 g) In case of an empty scrotum with no palpable gonad on physical examination but intra-abdominal mass seen during surgery - it suggests that the patient has undergone spontaneous descent in utero (vanishing testes). The presence of abdominal mass indicates that the processus vaginalis was patent enough to allow the growth of abdominal structures into the inguinal canal. This means that even if the testicle had descended initially, it would have been unable to remain within the scrotal sac because of lack of space. So, this condition does not require surgical intervention. However, if the intraabdominal structure is found to be testis by histopathology after excision, then orchidectomy needs to be performed. If the intra-abominal mass is non-testicular, then it requires appropriate treatment according to its nature. In such cases, since the testicles were never present in the abdomen, they do not need to be removed. But, the process of hernia repair must be completed. An open approach through the groin may be required to remove these masses. Laparoscopic techniques can also be used successfully. Ref : Schwaz's principle of surgery 9th edition Pgno : 1545-1550

D) Cochlear nucleus
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g D i.e., Cochlear Nuclei
Hence, the correct answer is D (Cochlear nucleus). In BERA waves I-V represent different structures along auditory pathway - Wave I : cochlea & vestibular division of VIIIth cranial nerve; Wave II : spiral ganglion cells; Wave III : facial nerve fibers within internal acoustic meatus; Wave IV : superior veical branch of facial nerve; Waves V & VI : dorsal & ventral divisions of superior olivaries; Wave VII : lateral leminiscus; Wave VIII : inferior colliculus; Wave IX : medial geniculate body; Wave X : Auditory radiation to temporal lobe; Wave XI : Transverse gyri of Heschl's; Wave XII : Posterior pa of superior temporal gyrusQ.
Wave I is most sensitive to air conduction while wave V is more sensitive to bone conduction. Therefore, it can be used to detect conductive hearing loss. It has been found that children with otitis media have abnormal waveforms on BERA testing even when pure tone audiometry shows no evidence of hearing impairment. This test may therefore prove useful in early detection of deafness due to middle ear pathology. However, this finding needs fuher confirmation by larger"

### Response:
 g B i.e., IV normal saline & Potassium
Hence, the correct answer is B (I.V. norma1 saline and potassiuM). Explanation: Metabolic Alkalosis in children with emesis can be treated by giving isotonic fluid containing sodium chloride along with K+ to prevent hypokalemia. Hypochloremic metabolic alkaloses may occur due to excessive loss of gastric secretions that contain large amounts of HCl. This type of disorder occurs most commonly after prolonged episodes of vomiting. Treatment consists of replacement of volume deficit with isotonic NaCI solution plus administration of K+. If severe hypokalemic metabolic alkalos develops during therapy, it should be corrected first with intravenous KCI infusion while continuing the correction of acid-base abnormality with intravenously administered NH4 CI.

### Response:
 g Resilience is defined as the ability to absorb energy without permanent deformation (i.e., elastic strain).
Hence, the correct answer is B (ResilIENCE). (Ref: Orthodontics: Diagnosis & Management of Malocclusion & Dentofacial Deformities 3rd edition page no 8)
Orthodontic wires have been classified into three categories based on their properties:

1. Beta-titanium alloy

Beta titanium alloys possess high strength-to-weight ratio with good formability and low modulus of elasticity.

2. Nickel-titanum alloy

Nickel-titanimum has similar characteristics to beta-titanim but it also possesses higher corrosion resistance than beta-titaniunm.

3. Stainless steel

Stainless-steel wires exhibit lower flexibility compared to both beta-titianium and nickel-titaninium; however they can be used in certain situations where increased rigidity is required such as anchorage reinforcement.
The range of an archwire refers to its cross-sectional area at different points along its length. The proportional limit represents the point beyond which plastic deformation occurs. The formability of an archive describes how easily it may be bent by hand forces. These factors all contribute to the overall performance of an appliance system.

### Response:
 g Open-ended collimation (shielding) reduces unnecessary radiation exposure by limiting the field size to that area being imaged.

Ref: Oral Radiology Principles & Interpretation / Stuart C White; Michael J Pharoah - 7th ed page no-8
Hence, the correct answer is D (An open ended,. shielded). (Note : Lead aprons also reduce somatic exposure but it doesnot have much effect on scatter reduction).
The image shows an example of open-ended collimator in action.
Explanation :
SOMATIC EXPOSURE

It refers to direct irradiation of patients during dental imaging procedures.
Reduction of Somatic Exposure:

Use of lead-lined collimators with small apertures will decrease the amount of scattered photons reaching the receptor and thus reduce the dose received by the patient.
Lead-lined collimations can be either fixed or variable aperture types.
Variable-aperture collimations allow the operator to adjust the beam width according to the thickness of the oral tissues through which the X-ray must pass.
This adjustment decreases the volume of tissue exposed to ionizing radiation while maintaining adequate diagnostic information.
In addition, using rectangular collimations instead of circular ones may further reduce the volume exposed because they more closely approximate the shape of the region of interest.

D) Overstimulation of respiratory centre
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
  A. Itching

Morphine is an opioid analgesic that can cause itching (pruritus), nausea, constipation, drowsiness, confusion, slow breathing rate, low blood pressure, shallow breathing, weak pulse, coma, and death in overdose. Morphine also causes urinary retention by increasing sphincter tone at bladder neck and inhibiting micturation reflexes. In addition to these side effects, it may increase intraocular tension due to increased aqueous humor secretion. 
It does not stimulate respiration but rather depresses it; therefore, caution should be used when administering this drug to patients who have pulmonary disease such as asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease. This medication has been shown to decrease cerebral oxygen consumption while maintaining mean arterial blood pressure during hemorrhage. However, its use in head injury remains controversial because of potential increases in intracranial pressure. Morphinan derivatives like morphine produce histamine release which results in flushing, hypotension, tachycardia, bronchospasm, pruritis, urticaria, wheezing, syncope, and anaphylactoid reactions. These symptoms occur more frequently among asthmatic individuals than non-asthma sufferers. Pruritus without rash occurs commonly"

Question: Bonding agents have hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups. The hydrophobic group binds which structure?
Options:
A) Calcium in enamel
B) Hydroxyapatite group in hard tissue
C) Resin in restoration
D) Collagen in dentin
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 gHence, bonding agent is used to bond resin with tooth structure (enamel/dentin).
Hence the correct answer is C (Resin in restorative material). (Ref: Sturdevant's operative dentistry 7th ed pg 68)
The chemical composition of most current adhesive systems includes four components:

Monomer(s), usually methacrylate-based resins that form the bulk of the system;
Solvent(s);
Adhesion promoter(s); and
Inhibitor(s).

These components interact synergistically to produce an effective bonding layer between the tooth surface and the composite resin.

Key Concept:
Bonding agent has both hydrophillic & hydrophobic parts. 
Hydrophobic part bonds with resin whereas hydrophililc part interacts with water present on the tooth surfaces.
Hence it acts like bridge b/w two materials i.e., tooth + resin.
HENCE IT IS CALLED AS A BONDING AGENT.

Question: Antimalarial drug used for causal prophylaxis act at which stage of developmental cycle
Options:
A) Gametogony
B) Erythrocytic schizogony
C) Pre-erythrocytic schizogony
D) Exo-erythrocytic schizogony
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g C i.e., Pre erytroctye schizogany
Hence, the correct answer is C (Pre-erythyrocytic Schizogny). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine - 18th edition page no. 1387)
Antimalarials acting in pre-erytrocytic phase include chloroquine & primaquine.
Chloroquine acts on both exo- & endo- erythrocyte stages but has maximum effect during pre-erithrocyte phase.
Primaquine is active against all forms except trophozoites within RBCs.
Atovaquone also inhibits mitochondrial electron transport chain in plasmodium falciparum.
Mefloquine blocks P-glycoprotein efflux pump that pumps out haemoglobin from food vacuole to cytoplasm where it can be detoxified by heme degradative pathway.
Quinine binds to DNA & inhibit topoisomerase II enzyme activity.
Tetracyclines bind to ribosomes & inhibit protein synthesis.
Sulfonamides interfere with folate metabolism.
Hence the correct answe is C(pre-erythrocvtic schizognv). I am sure you will"

Question: Retraction of the protruded mandible is done by
Options:
A) Medial Pterygoid
B) Lateral pterygoid
C) Masseter
D) Temporalis
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
  Temporalis 
Hence, the correct answer is D (Temporais). (Ref : BDC vol2 pg 276)
Hence the correct Answer is D ((Temporalis). Ref : B DC Vol II page no - 277,278
Explanation: The temporalis muscle arises from the lower half of the anterior surface of the greater wing of sphenoid bone; it inses into the coronoid process of mandible & zygomatic arch. It elevates the mandible to close the mouth.
The medial ptery goid originates from lateral side of lateral pterygid plate&inses in head of medialis pterygoi d plate.it adducts the mandibule during closing of jaw.the masseter arise from upper pa of ramus of mandibles &insertion on lateral aspect of angle of mandbles.it elevate the mandble during mastication,the lateral pterigoids originate from infratemporal fossa&insers in discoidal end of medial pterigoide plate.it depresses the mandbile during opening of jaws.

Question: Methacholine acts at which receptor?
Options:
A) M1
B) M2
C) M3
D) M4
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g B i.e., M2Methacholine is an agonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), paicularly those that have high affinity to M2 mAChR subtypesQ.Muscular cholinergic system consists of two types of postganglionic neurons in parasympathetic nervous system - type A & Type C.Type A neuron contains Acetylcholinerestase but no acetyltransferase; whereasType C neuron contain both enzymes.Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) also act on these nerve endings through P2 purinoceptors.The ganglia of autonomic nervous system consist of three types of cells:-Ganglion cell-Postganglionsynapse-Schwann cellThe preganglionic fibres synapses with either main ganglion cell or small ganglion cells.Main ganglioncellSmall ganglioncellsMain ganglioncellextends long processes into blood vessels.Small ganglion cellexists within connective tissue capsule of gangliion.These cells do not extend their process beyond the ganglion capsule.Preganglionic fibers release Ach by exocytosisQ which binds to nicotinic cholinoceptor present on postsynaptic membrane of ganglion ceils.Nicot"
