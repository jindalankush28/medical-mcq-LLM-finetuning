Question: A Iaday 35 years old lactating mother Presented with a Painful breast lump. Most appropriate initial investigation should be:
Options:
A) Mammography
B) USG
C) MRI
D) X-ray
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Ultrasound is usually used to evaluate palpable lumps in women under age 40 who do not have symptoms of advanced disease (e.g., nipple discharge). It can also help differentiate cystic lesions from solid masses. Invasive lobular carcinoma may appear deceptively benign on ultrasound. If there is still uncertainty after an ultrasound evaluation, biopsy is indicated. Ref : Sabiston 20th edition Pgno : 845-846
Hence, the correct answer is B (USG). (Ref : Sabistons 20 th /e p 845 - 46).Mamogram is contraindicated during pregnancy & Lactation.
Hence it is necessary to rule out Breast cancer by doing USG.
The most common cause of painful breast mass in young woman is Fibroadenoma.
Fibroadenomas are typically well circumscribed, round or oval tumors that feel firm but mobile within the breast tissue. They often contain small areas of calcification which show up on mammograms.
They tend to grow rapidly over several months then stabilize and remain unchanged in size for many years before disappearing spontaneously.
Treatment consists of simple excision if they become symptomatic or cosmetically unacceptable.

### Response:
 g D i.e., IntestinesCountercurrent heat exchange occurs between two adjacent vessels with different blood flow directionsQ (eg; renal aeriovenous anastomoses of kidney & testicular aerial- venous anatomoises). It helps to conserve water by reabsorption into the bloodstream at sites where it would otherwise be lost through evaporation eg; kidneys, inner ear, eye, brain, spinal cord, vagina, penis etc.Countercurrent Heat ExchangeIn this system, one vessel carries hot fluid past another that carries cold fluid but in opposite direction so that there is no net transfer of heat along their length. This type of arrangement conserves energy because less metabolic energy is required to maintain body temperature when countercurrent systems are used instead of parallel ones.Examples includeRenal circulation - The vasa recti run close together on either side of the medulla, they have very thin walls and contain relatively little muscle. They lie within the peritubular capillary plexus which surrounds the tubules. Blood flows towards the apex of the loop of Henle in the descending limb and then back down again in the ascending limb. Because of these opposing currents, heat generated by active transpo in the thick segment of the ascending loop of hen"

D) Fires
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g) Meteorological disasters cause most of the natural calamities in India. The major meteorological hazards include cyclones, droughts, floods, cold waves, heat waves etc. Cyclone is one of the most destructive weather phenomena that can affect coastal areas. It causes flooding due to heavy rainfall and storm surges leading to loss of life and damage to crops, houses and infrastructure. Droughts occur when there is deficiency of water over a prolonged period of time resulting in crop failure and livestock death. Heat wave occurs when temperature rises above normal level for several days together. Cold wave refers to an abnormally low minimum temprature persisting at least two consecutive days. Ref : Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine; 24th edition - Page no. 741
Hence, the correct answer is B (Meterological). In India, meterological events account for more than half of all natural disasters. Amongst these, flood accounts for majority followed by landslides & cyclones. Earthquakes also have significant impact on human lives but they are less frequent compared to others. Fire related incidents are usually man-made rather than natural disasters.
Hence fire-related accidents do not fall under natural disasters category.

### Response:
 ganser syndrome (also known as pseudodementia, hysterical dementia, or folie à deux) is a condition in which patients present with symptoms that mimic those of organic brain disorders such as delirium, schizophrenia, depression, catatonia, dissociation, amnesia, aphasia, agnosia, apraxia, hallucinations, and convulsions. It can be caused by severe stress, trauma, abuse, neglect, emotional distress, anxiety, fear, grief, guilt, shame, anger, frustration, boredom, loneliness, low self-esteem, lack of control, powerlessness, helplessness, loss of identity, and/or social isolation. Ganser's syndrome has been described in prisoners who have attempted to feign insanity in order to gain leniency from their sentences; it may occur in people suffering extreme physical discomfort due to hunger, thirst, cold, heat, fatigue, sleep deprivation, etc.; and it may develop during interrogation under duress. In some cases, individuals will adopt the beliefs and behaviors of another person with mental illness, often an acquaintance or family member, resulting in what is called ""folie à plusieurs"" (""madness of several"").

### Response:
 gans Syndrome (Syndrome X): It was first described by Epstein et al. in 1980. The term ""syndrome"" has been used to describe patients with angina pectoris without evidence of coronary artery disease on angiography. These patients have normal left ventricular function but show abnormal vasodilatory capacity of the coronary vessels. They also exhibit exaggerated vasoconstriction in response to adrenergic stimulation. This results in ischemia due to increased oxygen demand and decreased supply. Ref : Park's Textbook Of Preventive And Social Medicine By K.Park,20th Edition, Page-567
Hence, the correct answer is D (More chances of syncopal attacks). (Ref: Park's PSM - 20th ed pg 567)
Note: The most common cause of chest pain in young women who do not smoke cigarettes is microvascular spasm caused by endothelial dysfunction. This condition can be treated medically using calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine or diltiazem. If medical therapy fails, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty may help relieve symptoms. In some cases, this procedure will result in complete relief of symptoms; however, it does not treat the underlying problem"

Options:
A) Estrogen
B) Testosterone
C) DHEAS
D) Progesterone
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 
Explanation: Ans is c i.e., DHEA-S Adrenal coisol (cortisol), aldosterone & sex hormones - dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-sulfate). The zona glomerulosa secretes mineralocoicoid hormone (aldosterone); the zona fasciculata produces glucocorticoids (coisol) and small amounts of sex steroids; and the zona reticularis synthesizes primarily DHEAs. Note : Ovaries also produce some amount of DHEa but it is much less than that produced by adrenals. So in female body most impoant source of DHA is adrenlas.
Hence, the correct answer is C (D HEAS). (\(Note\): This question has been repeated several times before).
The main function of Aldosterone is to regulate electrolyte balance between ECF and ICF mainly Na+ K+
Adrenal Coisol regulates carbohydrate metabolism, protein catabolism, lipid metabolism, immune system etc.
Deoxy-corticosteron (DOC) is secreted by Zona Glomerulasa which stimulates reabsorption of sodium ions in distal tubules.

### Response:
 g Option A - 500 microgram (0.50ml) of Adrenaline 1 :10,000 solution intramuscularly repeated every few minutes if necessary until medical help arrives. The recommended dosage of epinephrine for treatment of anaphy- laxis is 0.3 to 0,6 mg administered subcutaneously or intra-muscularly; this can be repeated every five to fifteen min- ues as needed. This equates to approximately 0.
Hence, the correct answer is B (0..5 ml). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 18th edition pg 2148)

### Response:
 givens are

Cold-cure resins have higher ratio than hot-cured ones.

Ratio is always more by volume than weight (as density of monomers > polymers).
Hence, the correct answer is A (3: 1 by Volume and 21 by Weight). (- Ref S.O.P 5th/e p-55)
Note - The same concept applies to all types of composite materials like amalgam etc.
Key Concept: 
The ratio between monomer & polymer in cold cured composites is greater compared with that of heat cured compositres.

### Response:
 g. This image shows an example of cross-matching done before giving blood to patient. The purpose of cross matching is to ensure that there will be no adverse reaction when donor's blood is infused into recipient's body. It involves testing compatibility between donor & recipient red cells by agglutination test using serum from both donors & recipients. If antibodies against ABO antigens are present in either sera then it indicates incompatible blood group & should never be used. Antibodies may also develop after pregnancy, previous blood transfusions etc. So even if compatible blood was previously matched, re-crossmatching must always be performed prior to administration of new unit of blood.
Hence, the correct answer is D (Prevent blood mismatch). (Ghai Essential pediatrics, eighth edition, page 347)
The text below has been taken from various sources on internet which explains more details regarding Cross Matching.

Crossmatch

In order to prevent alloimmunization due to exposure to foreign RBCs, patients who require multiple units of packed RBC need to have their blood typed and crossmatched with all proposed donor units.

 giant cell formation is seen in herpes simplex infection caused by HSV-1 &2.it can be confirmed by Tzank smear test done on vesicle base showing multinucleate gaint cells,necrotic keratinocytes & ballooning degeneration.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Multinucleation). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 18th edition pg no. 1388 table 162-3)
Hence it is option B that is correct here.
Explanation: The image shows typical lesions of herpes labialis caused by reactivation of latent HSV -1 infection. Primary HSV infections usually occur during childhood and result in lifelong latency in sensory ganglia. Reactivation occurs when viral DNA migrates down axons to skin sites where replication produces new virions that cause disease. Recurrent episodes may follow an annual cycle but also can be precipitated by stress, immunosuppression, menstruation, sun exposure, cold weather, trauma, surgery, and emotional upset. Oral acyclovir therapy initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset reduces both pain and duration of recurrent episodes; however, prophylactic use does not prevent recurrences.

### Response:
 g. The treatment of choice in acute upper GI bleed due to variceal hemorrhage is endoscopic sclerotherapy (or ligation). It has been shown that this method reduces mortality by half compared with conservative therapy alone. If hemostasis cannot be achieved during an emergency procedure, then balloon tamponade should be performed until definitive control can be obtained at another time. Somatostatin analogues such as octreotide have also been found useful in controlling active varicea! hemorrhage. They reduce portal venous pressure by decreasing splanchnic blood flow without causing significant hypotension. A transjugular intrahepatic poosystemic stent shunt may be placed if pharmacologic measures fail to stop the bleeding. This technique allows decompression of the systemic circulation while maintaining hepatic perfusion. Ref : Sabiston Textbook of Surgery, 18th edn /pg no-1089

### Response:
  B i.e., Revascularisation in  12 & RCT 11 
Hence, the correct answer is B (Revascularization of 2nd molar). Ref : Textbook of Pedodontics by Arathi Rao page no 210-211
Explanation: The treatment plan depends on whether the tooth is mature or immature at the time of injury.

If it's an immature permanent tooth, revascularization therapy should be considered because apexogenesis can preserve more tooth structure than extraction followed by space closure with orthodontic appliances or prosthetics.
In case of mature teeth, endodontic therapy is indicated.
The main goal of revascularisation therapy is to promote healing within the pulp chamber and root canals through the introduction of stem cells present in the periradicular tissues into the infected area. This process results in tissue regeneration rather than just repair.
Stem cell niches have been identified in the apical papilla, periodontal ligament, dental follicle, and cementum. These areas contain mesenchymal stem cells that differentiate into odontoblasts and form dentin bridges over time.
This approach may also reduce inflammation and prevent bacterial growth due to its antimicrobial properties.

### Response:
 g The first permanent molar has been found to have the greatest tendency of displacement among all teeth because it is located at the end of both dental arches and its position can easily change with growth changes occurring either distally or mesially.

Ref: Orthodontics: Diagnosis and Management of Malocclusion and Dentofacial Deformities by John M. Palomo page 1080
Hence, the correct answer is A (First molar). (REF: Textbook of ORTHODONTICS Sridhar Premkumar PAGES NO- 1079).
 
Explanation: The tooth that displaces furthest during orthodontic treatment is the maxillary central incisor followed closely by the mandible lateral incisors. This may seem counterintuitive since these teeth do not contact their opposing counterparts until late in development; however, they are subjected to considerable forces throughout life from lip pressure and tongue thrusting. In addition, the roots of these teeth are short compared with those of posterior teeth, making them more susceptible to tipping than bodily movement.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g C (Cast metal)
Hence, the correct answer is C (cast metal). (Ref: Sturdevant operative dentistry 7th ed pg  364-365; Phillips Science of Dental Materials 12th edition page no 403).
The restorations can be divided into two types:

Interim restoratins

Temporary filling material used until final restoration is done.

Permanent restorative materials

Used in permanent teeth.
In this case since it's a first molar tooth that has been involved by caries, we need to do a permanent restoration. 
Among the given options cast metal alloy is the most suitable one because it provides maximum strength and durability compared to others.
Composite resin would also have been an acceptable answer but it does not match up to the properties provided by cast metal alloys.
GICs cannot be considered here due to their poor mechanical properties.
Intermediate restoratives like zinc phosphate cement should never be used in permanent restorative procedures.
Hence among the given choices cast metal is the best answer.
Sturdevants Operative Dentistry 8/e p. 366 states ""When both buccal cusps are present on a posterior tooth, they must be restored using either amalgam or gold.""

Question: At low infusion rates of 3-5 mcg/kg/min, what action is produced by dopamine?
Options:
A) Vasoconstriction
B) Increased renal blood flow
C) Increased cardiac contractility
D) Decreased blood pressure
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 
Explanation: Dopamine at doses less than 10 micrograms per kilogram per minute increases the force of contraction of hea without increasing oxygen consumption. It also causes vasodilation in kidney and mesentery. Ref: KD Tripathi 8th ed page no 107
Hence, the correct answer is C (Increased cardiac contractibility). (Ref: KD tripatii 7/e p108; Katzung 12/e p172). However it should be noted that according to Goodman & Gilman 13/e p168 ""At very low concentrations (<2 mg/ kg /min), dopamine stimulates D1 receptors on renal vessels causing dilation"". So increased renal blood flows can occur even with lower dose but this is an indirect effect through stimulation of D1 receptor whereas direct positive ionotropic effects occurs when concentration exceeds 2mg/kg/min. Therefore we have taken increased cardiac contractability as our answer here.
Hence increase in cardiac output will lead to decrease in BP due to baroreceptor reflexes. But since there was no option related to decreased BP, vasoconstrictor action has been considered more appropriate choice here.

### Response:
 g The central value is also called median which divides the data into two equal halves (50% on either side).
Hence, the correct answer is C (2nd quintile). (Ref : Park's Textbook of PSM 25th edition Page no-850)
Quintiles

Quartiles divide the distribution curve in to four equal parts i.e., Q1,Q2 &Q3
Deciles divide it into ten equal pas i.e D1,D2...D10
Percentiles divide into hundred equal pa i.e,P1,P2..P100
Hence,
Median = Q2= 5th Quintile
75th Percentile = 7.5 Decile
80th Centile =8th Decile etc.

### Response:
 greatest amount of leeway space in both jaws occurs between primary and secondary cuspids (canine). The next greatest amounts occur between first and second molars and between lateral and central incisors. There is little if any leeway space between the remaining anterior and posterior teeth.
Hence, the correct answer is A (Space differential between decadent canine and mole and their suceedant permanent teeth). (- Ref BDC vol-3 pg no - 280)
Leeway spaces

The term ""leeway"" was coined by Rolf Behrents in 1977.

It refers to the difference in size between the developing deciduous tooth germs and those that succeed them.
In general, there is more than enough room in the dental arches for all the succeeding teeth; however, this extra space decreases with age because some areas have less growth potential than others.
This phenomenon has been called the ""law of diminishing returns,"" which means that although there may be sufficient space at an early stage for normal development of all teeth, it will become insufficient when the rate of eruption exceeds the capacity of the jaw to grow.

Question: According to Weber-Fechner's law, strength of stimulus perceived is directly propoional to:

A) Intensity of stimulus
B) Amplitude of action potential
C) Number of neurons stimulated
D) Number of receptors stimulated
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g A (Intesity of stimulus): Ref: Ganong, 22nd ed, p. 55Weber - Fechner Law states that ""the intensity of sensation felt by an individual in response to a physical stimulus is proportional to log of the magnitude of the stimulating force"". This means if we double the intensity of a stimulus, it will be sensed as being four times stronger than before. The same applies when the intensity is tripled; it would then seem eight times more intense than previously. In simple terms, this means that our senses do not respond linearly to changes in stimuli. For example, doubling the volume on your stereo does not make sound twice louder but rather four times louder. Similarly, increasing the temperature of water from 40deg C to 80deg C makes no difference at all because both temperatures feel warm. However, going from 30deg Cto 60deg C doubles the sense of warmth. Thus, according to the Weber-Fechners' law, the greater the initial value of a sensory stimulus, the smaller must be the change required to produce a noticeable increase in its subjective magnitude. It also explains why small amounts of salt added to food may go unnoticed while large amount of sugar can easily be detected even though they have similar"

### Response:
 g C i.e., Calcium Gluonate Tetany refers to muscle cramps & spasms due to hypocalcemiaQ (low calcium levels). It can also occur in hypermagnesemiaQ. The first line treatment is intravenous infusion of calcium gluconatQ which will rapidly correct serum calcium level.

### Response:
 g) Pulmonary anthrax is also known as wool sorter's disease because it was prevalent among workers in woolen mills who used to sort raw wool contaminated with infected animal hair. It may follow inhalation of spores that have been aerosolized during processing of infected animals products such as hides, furs, bone meal, meat, etc. The incubation period ranges between 2-5 days. Clinical features include fever, cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnea, cyanosis, edema of face & neck, marked toxemia, meningitis, septic shock, hemorrhages into pleura, pericardium, meninges, GI tract, under skin & mucous membranes. Chest X-ray shows patchy infiltrates progressing rapidly to complete consolidation followed by collapse.

### Response:
 g Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th edition & Goodman Gillman Manual of Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 12th ed.Explanation: LMW Heparins have more consistent bioavailability than UFH due to lower affinity for plasma proteins; they can be administered once daily in fixed doses without monitoring their anti-Xa activity. They do not require laboratory monitoring since it does not cross placenta and thus safe during pregnancy. The most common adverse effect associated with use of low-molecular-weight heparins is bleeding. Other side effects include injection site pain, skin necrosis at the injection site, osteoporosis, alopecia, hyperkalemia, and elevated liver enzymes. Thrombocytopenia may occur but is rare compared to that seen with warfarin. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, X, Protein C and S. Vitamin K antagonists such as warfarine act on factor II, which requires post-translational modification involving gamma carboxylation of glutamic acid residues. This reaction requires reduced coenzyme A derived from dietary vitamin K. Thus, when vitamin K levels fall, this process cannot proceed and active forms of these clotting molecules fail to form."

### Response:
 greatest branch of mandible nerve supplies skin over parotid gland,angle of mouth & lower pa of ear lobe
Hence, the correct answer is A (Mandibular Nerve). (Ref: BD Chaurasia 7th edition Page no: 55)
The greater auricular nerves arise in the neck at the level of the cricoid cartilage, where they join together to form a common trunk which then divides into two branches. The trunks pass upwards on either side of the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle, pierce the platysma and continue up onto the scalp. On reaching the base of the skull it turns medially across the upper pa of the parotids and passes between them and the styloid process to reach the angle formed by the junction of the lateral pterygoid plate with the ramus of the mandible. Here it ends by dividing into several small filaments that spread out upon the undersurface of the masseter muscle and cover its whole extent down to the angle.

 g Option B - If person was previously vaccinated then he needs to receive rabies immunoglobulin (RIG). The dose of RIG should be calculated based upon body weight. It can be administered either at one site or multiple sites. In case of post exposure prophylaxis after dog bite, it is recommended that RIG be infiltrated into the wound(s), if accessible. Any remaining volume of RIB should be injected i.m. around the injection site.

 g D i.e., Mollusk shellsBiomineralisation refers to the formation of minerals through an organic matrixQ. It occurs in mollusks & corals where calcium carbonate forms crystals within protein fibers that form their skeletons.Q
Hence, the correct answer is D (Mollusc Shell). (Ref: Textbook of Biochemistry Dr JG Raju 6th edition page no-7).
The term biomineralizaton was first used by Mann S et al in 1988 to describe the deposition of mineral phases into specific morphological patterns under control of cells and/or macromolecules. The most common example of this phenomenon is bone formation but it also applies to many other tissues such as teeth, scales, exoskeletons etc. In all these cases there is close association between organic molecules and ions of Ca2+, PO42-, CO32- etc. These interactions lead to nucleation of crystalline aggregates of one or more elements at sites on the surface of proteins or polysaccharides. This results in the production of highly ordered arrays of atoms with unique physical propeies. For eg. Bone contains hydroxyapatite crystals embedded in a network of collagen fibrils.

### Response:
 g protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), also known as seven-transmembrane domain receptors, serpentine GPCRs, heptahelical receptors, endomembrane receptors, or serpentina, are a large family of membrane-associated receptor proteins that respond to a variety of stimuli, including hormones, neurotransmitters, light, odors, drugs, and many others. They contain seven transmembrane alpha-helixes connected by loops. The ligand-binding region lies within this pocket between these helices. These receptors interact with guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins (G proteins). There are two main types of GPCR signaling pathways: those which stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels; and those which activate phospholipases C, resulting in an increase in diacylglycerol (DAG) and IP3 (inositol triphosphate).

Non contraceptive uses of progestins:

Endometrioses
Fibroid uterus
Menorrhagia

Emergency contraception can be achieved by using high doses of progesterone like Levonorgestreol.

Note: Progesterones have been used in treatment of menorrhagias but it has to be combined with an OCP containing estrogen also because otherwise there will be atrophy of the endometium leading to amenorrhea.
Progesterones alone should never be prescribed without concomitant administration of Estrogen because they cause atrophic changes on prolonged use which may lead to Amenorrhea and Atrophy of vagina & cervix.

C) At least one case of non-polio AFP per year per 1000 population of under 15 years
D) At least one case of non-polio AFP per year per 100000 population of under 15 years
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
  - Surveillance is defined as ""the continuous scrutiny of the factors that determine occurrence & distribution of disease in human populations"".
- The aim of surveillance is to detect trends & patterns which may indicate emerging health problems before they become established.
- It also helps in identifying areas where special action should be taken.
- In India, National Poliomyelitis Surveillance Project (NPSP) was launched on 1st April 1995 with technical assistance from WHO & financial suppo from UNICEF.
- Under this project, all cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), irrespective of whether it is due to polio or not, were being reported by every district throughout the country so that incidence of paralytic illness could be determined accurately.
- For effective implementation of NPSP, at least one medical officer has been designated in each subcentre who will act as Medical Officer Incharge of Acute Flacid Paralysis (MO-AFP).
Hence, the correct answer is A (At least one cae of non-poliq AFP per yeat per 10QO population of unde 5 veas). (Ref : Park's textbook of PSM 22nd edition page no. 101)

### Response:
 g C i.e., Auditory Nerve Streptomyces griseus produces an antibiotic which is used against tuberculosisQ (S.T.B.) & gram negative infections like pseudomonas infection. It has poor activity on gram positive bacteria. Aminoglycosides can cause nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity (auditory nerve), neuromuscular blockade etc. - Harrison
Hence, the correct answer is C (Auditory nerve). (Ref: Textbook of Microbiology by Ananthanarayan and Paniker 8th/ p. 401)
Streptomycin was first isolated from S. griseous Q in 1943. The drug acts primarily on bacterial cell wall but also interferes with protein synthesis at ribosome level. Resistance develops rapidly due to production of enzyme that phosphorylates it. Adverse effects include vestibular disturbances, tinnitus, deafness, rashes, fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, bone marrow depression, renal toxicity, peripheral neuritis, optic neuritis & exfoliative dermatosis.

Question: Considering the latent period of muscle twitch to be 10 ms, contraction time 40 ms and relaxation time 50 ms, what will be the tetanizing frequency for this muscle?
Options:
A) 25 Hz
B) 50 Hz
C) 100 Hz
D) 75 Hz
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Option B is correct because total duration = Latent + Contraction + Relaxation = 10+40+50=100ms; Tetanus occurs when stimulus is applied at such rapid rate that there is no interstimulus interval (i.e., successive stimuli occur before previous one has ended). Therefore, maximum possible number of twitches in 1 second would be 1/total duration i.e. 1 / 0.1 s = 100 times per sec or 100Hz.
Hence, the correct answer is C (100 Hz). (Ref: Ganong's physiology 23rd ed pg 96)
The minimum strength of current required to produce an action potential is called threshold value of membrane.
Threshold Potential:- The point on the curve where it makes sudden jump into another phase is known as Threshold Point. At rest, the cell membrane is said to have resting potential. When depolarization reaches -55 mV, Na+ channels open up suddenly and cause large influx of sodium ions inside the fiber which causes further depolarisation. This level of -55mV is called ""threshold"" level. If the initial stimulation fails to reach the threshold level, then the nerve impulse does not develop. However if the intensity of the stimulus exceeds the"

### Response:
 g Epigenetic changes do not alter DNA sequence but affect how genes are expressed in cells. These epigenetic modifications include histone modification (e.g., methylation & acetyla­tion), chromatin remodeling, non-coding RNA-mediated regulation, and environmental factors such as diet and stress.

Ref : Robbins Basic Pathology, Kumar Abul Kasiar Abbas, Jonathan P. Headley, Vinod Paul - 9th edn; pg no-20
Hence, the correct answer is A (Epigenetics). (Ref: Robbins Basic pathology 8/e p21). The term ""epigenesis"" was first used to describe embryonic development, which involves both genetic information encoded within an organism's genome and interactions between its environment and genotype that influence phenotypic traits. More recently, it has been applied more broadly to refer to all heritable mechanisms of gene regulation that occur independently of genomic sequences themselves. This includes processes like DNA methylation, Histone Modification, Chromatin Remodeling etc.
The most common mechanism of epigenetics is Methylation of CpG islands at promoter regions of Genes. It prevents transcription of those genes. Acetyl group addition on H3K16 also helps in Gene activation.

D) Sitagliptin
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 glinide analogues (e.g., saxagliptine, vildagliplatin, sitagliptan) should be avoided because they may cause hypoglycemia when used with insulin secretagogues. However, linaglipten is primarily excreted by bile; therefore it does not require dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment or those with severe renal disease.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Linaglipti). (Ref: Harrison's Internal Medicine 18th edition chapter 344)
The DPP-IV inhibitors include sitagliptein, vladgliptin, saxaglipltin, and linagliplitin. They inhibit the breakdown of incretin hormones GLP1 & GIP which increases glucose dependent release of insulin. The major route of elimination of these agents is through kidney except linaglipi tin which undergoes biliary excretion. Therefore, no dosage adjustments required in case of renal insufficiency but caution needed in liver dysfunction due to risk of increased plasma concentration.
Harrison writes - ""In contrast to the other oral DPP4 inhibitors, linaglipin has negligible renal clearance (<5%) and thus requires little if any dose reduction in patients with impaired renal function.""

 ganser syndrome is an organic confusional state that can be seen in patients with severe head trauma, encephalitis, intracranial hemorrhage, brain tumors, and metabolic disorders such as hepatic failure, renal failure, and electrolyte imbalances. It has also been repoed to occur after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The symptoms include apathy, amnesia, visual agnosia, construction apraxia, and delusions. These symptoms mimic those found in schizophrenia but do not respond to antipsychotic medications. Patients may have a ""clouding"" of consciousness and often present with pseudodementia. They will deny their illness and claim they feel fine when asked by physicians if anything is wrong. This denial is called anosognosia. Ganser's triad consists of approximate answers, clouding of consciousness, and hallucinations. Approximate answers are known as vorbeireden, which means literally ""speaking past.""

Temperature of incubator

The recommended range for incubators is between 32°c and 34 °c with humidity maintained at >80%
In general, it has been found that infants born before 31 weeks gestation require higher temperatures than those born later in pregnancy; however, this may vary depending on individual infant needs.

Note:

Room temperature = 20 – 25 oC
Body temp of newborns = 36.5 ±1.0 oC

Also know

Newborns lose heat by radiation & convection more rapidly than older children because their surface area-to-weight ratio is greater.
Infants who have lost body weight after birth need extra care to maintain warmth.
If an infant’s skin feels cool to touch, he/she requires passive rewarming using warm blankets or radiant warming devices.

### Response:
 g Ans. A. Open spino bifidao Acetyl Choline esterase (ACHE) is an impoant marker of open neural tube defects.o It can be detected in amniotic fluids by using immunological methods such as latex agglutination test,o The presence of ACHE indicates that there has been intracranial hemorrhage due to rupture of blood vessels within the brain tissue which occurs commonly with open NTDs like meningoceles & myelomeningoceles.o In gastroschis it doesnot occur because there will be no direct contact between fetal bowel contents and amnionic cavity.o Similarly omphalocoele also doestotally enclose the fetus so there wont be any chance of contamination of amniotics with fetal intestinal enzymes.
Hence, the correct answer is A (Open spina bilfida). (Ref: Textbook of Obstetrics D.C.Dutta 6th edition page 283).
The most common cause of increased levels of AFP in maternal serum during pregnancy is an open neural-tube defect in the developing central nervous system of the fetus.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g D: Blocking K channels

Explanation: The opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is necessary to allow influx of Ca2+, which triggers exocytosis of synaptic vesicles containing acetylcholine (ACh). If potassium channels are blocked, there will be more depolarization at the nerve terminal because less potassium leaves the cell. This results in increased frequency of action potentials that open Ca2+-channels and increases the amount of ACh released into the synapse.
Hence, the correct answer is D (Blocking K channles). (Ref: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology Twenty-Third Edition Page No: 95)
The figure shows how blocking K-channels can lead to increased neurotransmitter release by increasing the number of action potential firings per second.
Harrison’s Internal Medicine Table 370-1 lists some drugs used to treat myasthenia gravis; these include pyridostigmine, neostig mine, edrophonium, and ambroxol.

Options:
A) >500/mm3
B) >1000/ mm3
C) >1500/ mm3
D) >2000/ mm3
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g>1,000/mcL (or more than 5% of total WBCs)
Hence, the correct answer is B (>1000/mm3). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th edition, Page 672; Robbin's Basic Pathology, 7th Edition, Page No - 610).
The hypereosino­philic syndromes comprise a group of disorders charac­terized by persistent clonal expansion of mature eosinophils that may result in end-organ damage. The most common clinical manifestations include skin lesions, weight loss, fever, hepatomegaly, splenomegaley, lymphadenopathy, gastrointestinal symp­toms, cardiac involvement, neurologic symptoms, renal failure, pulmonary infiltrates, ocular abnormalities, and arthropathy. Eosinophilia must persist for longer than 6 mo to meet diagnostic criteria. In addition, there must be no evidence of an underlying infection, allergic reaction, malignancy, drug effect, or connective tissue disorder. Blood counts show absolute eosinophilia greater than 1,500/mL (more than 10% of white cells), often associated with leukocytosis and thrombocytopeenia. Bone marrow"

B) Pearson coefficient
C) Receiver-operating characteristic curve
D) Pre-test probability
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. Receiver-operative Characteristic Curve (ROC)
Hence, the correct answer is C (Receiver-operating characterstic curve). (Ref: Textbook of medical statistics by Indrayan & Sahnawaz, pg-86; Medical biostatistics By B. Rosner, Chapter 6.)
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve can be used to determine which cutpoint on a continuous measure should define a ""positive"" result in order to achieve an optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity.
Analysis of Variance - Used when comparing means among more than two groups.
Pearson Coefficient - Measures linear correlation between variables.
Pretest Probability - Is defined as the patient's pre-examination likelihood that he/she has disease X based upon clinical history, physical examination findings, laboratory results etc.
Hence,
""The ROC curve provides a visual representation of the relationship between sensitivity and false-positive rate at different thresholds.""
Textbook of Medical Statistics By V.K. Paul, Page No: 87

Sensitivity = True Positive / (True Positive + False Negative)

Specificity = True negative/ (False positive+ true negative)

Positive Predictive Value = TP/(TP+FP)

Question: Highest concentration of desmosomes are seen in which location?
Options:
A) A
B) B
C) C
D) D
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Option b is correct because it shows highest number of desmomes (intercellular adhesion). Desmosome - intercellular junctions that anchor intermediate filaments to plasma membrane Gap Junction - Intercellular channel through which ions & small molecules can pass directly between cells Tight Junction / Occluding Junction - Prevent free passage of substances across epithelium by fusing adjacent cell membranes together Hemidesmosome- Anchors keratin Intermediate Filament to basement membrane
Hence, the correct answer is B (B). Basal layer of epidermis has maximum no. of desmo-somes. It also contains hemi-desmosomes. The basal lamina lies just below this zone. This area is called stratum basale. Stratum spinosum consists of polyhedral cells with many short spines on their surface. These spiny projections represent tonofilaments attached to the desmosomal plaques at the sites where they join neighboring cells. In electron microscopy these appear like little ""desmosomes"" and hence the name ""stratum spinous"". Cells have large nuclei but few organelles. There are numerous mitochondria near the nucleus.

### Response:
 g. The digastrics muscle is spared in modified Radical Neck Dissection (MRND)
Hence, the correct answer is B (Digastricus muscle). (Note : Modified radical neck surgery preserves SCM, IJV & spinal accessory nerve).
The main difference between RND and MRND lies in preservation of CN XI, internal jugular veins and sternocleido mastoids muscles.
Modified Radical Neck Surgery - Preservation of one or more structures that are sacrificed during classical RND.
Types of Modified Radical Neck Surgeries

Supra-omohyoid neck dissections - Preserves all three major neurovascular bundles (CN XII, IX, X, XI; IJV; SCM), but sacrifices level VI lymph nodes.
Lateral neck disections - Preserve levels II to IV lymphatics with sacrifice of level V lymphatics.
Posterior triangle dissections (PND) - Sacrifice level V nodal basin while preserving levels I through IV.
Anterolateral neck surgeries - These include selective neck disfections which preserve specific anatomic areas such as submandibular triangles, anterior compament of neck etc.

### Response:
 gans of treatment include elastic stockings, intermittent pneumatic compres- sion devices (IPC), sclerotherapy, endovenous ablation techniques such as radiofrequency closure, laser therapy, surgical ligation and stripping, and phlebectomy. Stockings can be used to prevent venous stasis in patients with high risk factors for DVT. They work by providing graduated pressure that increases distally and decreases proximally. This helps push blood toward the hea while preventing it from pooling in the legs. IPCs also help reduce the incidence of postoperative thromboembolism by simulating normal muscle pump action. These devices apply sequential cycles of inflation followed by deflation on the lower extremities. Sclerosing agents cause endothelial damage when injected into varicosities. Endovenous methods involve using heat generated by either radio frequency energy or lasers to close incompetent veins under ultrasound guidance. Surgical removal of superficial varices has been shown to improve symptoms but does not decrease recurrence rates compared with noninvasive treatments. Ref: Schwaz's principle of surgery 9th edition Chapter 16.

### Response:
 g
Hence, the correct answer is C (Deflexion). (Ref: Williams Obstetrics 23rd edition page 548-549; Dutta Textbook of obstetrics 6th ed pg no 365)
Occipito posterior position

The most common malposition encountered in labour is that of occipto-posterior presentation which occurs in approximately 8% cases.

Causes:

1. Fetal factors - deflected chin, small biparietal diameter, post mature fetus with large soft skull, face to pubis delivery.
2. Pelvic factor - android type pelvis, narrow subpubic arch, flat sacrum, marked anterior concavity of side walls of inlet.
3. Malpresentation due to uterine anomaly - bicornuate uterus, septate uterus.


Clinical features:


FHS shows irregular rhythm and variable decelerations.
Pelvimetry reveals short transverse diameter of pelvic outlet.
USG confirms diagnosis by showing biparietals parallel to long axis of spine.

### Response:
 g Articaine is metabolized by ester hydrolysis to O-toluidine which is then conjugated with glucuronic acid (phase II metabolism). This makes it safe to use in patients with hepatic insufficiency.

Ref : Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Pg no : 845-846
Hence, the correct answer is A (Articainae). (Ref: Miller's Anesthesia 8/e p845-46; Morgan & Mikhail's Clinical Anaesthesiology 5/e p214)
The most common cause of death after bupivaca ine overdose is ventricular tachycardia. The drug should never be used alone for spinal anaesthesia because of its high potency and potential toxicity.

### Response:
 g Enlarged Blind Spot is seen in optic neuritis (optic atrophy), papilloedema, retinitis pigmentosa, CRAO & CRVO.
Hence, the correct answer is D (Papilledema). (Ref : Parson's disease of eye -20th edition page no- 310)
The normal size of blind spot is approximately 5° x 3 mm. The upper border lies on horizontal meridian; lower border is slightly below it. It extends medially up to the temporal fixation point and laterally till the nasal edge of disc. In case of enlarged blind spots, there will be an increase in its vertical diameter with loss of sharpness of margins. This may occur due to swelling of the retina around the disc such as papillomacular oedema or tractional changes like those occurring in retinal detachment. An enlarged blind spot can also result when the fibres passing through the inferior part of the optic nerve head have been damaged by compression of the nerve against the scleral rim, e.g., in severe papillophlebitis or raised intraocular pressure.

### Response:
 g. The number of psychiatrists in India is very low (1 per 2 lakh population). They are mostly concentrated in big cities and teaching institutions. There is no psychiatrist available in most primary health centers. In fact there is one psychiatrist for every 10-15 million people in our country. This has resulted in lack of psychiatric care to majority of patients who need it. It is estimated that less than 5% of all mentally ill persons receive treatment. Most of them do not have access to mental health services because they live far away from urban areas where such facilities exist. Even those living near these places cannot afford the cost of consultation which may be out of their reach. Many others fear stigma associated with seeking help for mental illness. As a result many cases go untreated and suffer silently. Ref: Park's Textbook of Preventive Medicine; 21st edition; Page no: 71

### Response:
 g. The most common cause of abnormal uterine bleeding (menorrhagias) after age 40 is endometrial cancer; however, it can also be caused by fibroids, polyps, adenomyosis, infection, thyroid disease, blood clotting disorders, tumors outside the reproductive tract, and medications such as tamoxifen, anticoagulants, antidepressants, and steroids. In this case since there is diffuse enlargement of uterus without an adnexa mass, the likely diagnosis would be adenomyositis which refers to growths of ectopic endometrium within myometrium. It occurs more commonly between ages 35-50 yrs. Symptoms include dyspareunia, pelvic pressure/ heaviness, painful menses, increased menstrual flow, prolonged periods, heavy intermestrual bleeding, infertility, preterm labor, postpaum hemorrhage, and premature delivery. Diagnosis is made on histological examination of hysterectomy specimen. Treatment includes GnRH agonists, progesterone therapy, danazol, Mirena IUD, and surgery (hysterectomy).

### Response:
 g C i.e., Ganglionic cell
Hence, the correct answer is C (Ganglion cells). (""The ganglion cell layer of retina is most vulnerable to damage by raised intraocular pressure"")- Parson's diseaseQ - Glaucoma is characterized clinically by an enlarged cupped disc with thin neuroretinal rim & visual field defects. The pathogenesis involves loss of retinal nerve fiber layer due to ischemia caused by increased IOP which damages axons of the ganglion cellsQ. It may also be associated with changes in blood-aqueous barrier permeability that allow proteins such as albumin to leak into aqueous humor. This protein leakage can lead to secondary open angle glaucoma. In addition, there is evidence suggesting that trabecular meshwork endothelial cells play a role in regulating aqueous outflow through active transport mechanisms involving Na+/K+ ATPase pumps. These pumps require energy derived from glucose metabolism; therefore, hypoxia induced by elevated IOP could impair aqueous drainage. Finally, recent studies have shown that matrix metalloproteinases produced by astrocytes within the lamina cribrosa contribute to degradation of extracellular matrix components surrounding the optic nerve head, thereby facilitating its collapse under high IOP."

### Response:
 gans causing candidiasis include C.albicans (most frequent), C.tropicalis, C.parapsilosi s,and less frequently C.krusei and C.glabrata. Infection with these fungi may be acquired through direct contact of skin lesions with contaminated hands or fomites; inhalation of conidia; ingestion of organisms present on food, water, or dust; or hematogenous spread from an infected site such as the gastrointestinal tract. Most cases of systemic disease occur in immunocompromised patients, paicularly those who have undergone bone marrow transplantation or chemotherapy. However, invasive infections also develop in premature infants and full-term newborns, especially when they receive prolonged intravenous therapy. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1258
Hence, the correct answer is D (Candida parapislovis). (Ref: Ananthanarayan 9th ed/pg 609-610)
The most common cause of oral thrush in HIV positive patient is - Candida Albicans

Question: A Young Male complained of intermittent pain, swelling and discharge at the base of spine. He also had episodes of fever and repeated abscesses that had burst spontaneously, in recent past. By occupation, he is a jeep driver. On physical examination, diagnosis of pilonidal sinus was made. Which flap-based procedure is used for pilonidal sinus surgery?
Options:
A) Rhomboid flap
B) Circular flap
C) Free flap
D) Rotational flap
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
  
Explanation: Pilonidal disease is an acquired condition caused by hair penetration into subcutaneous tissue. It occurs most commonly on the natal cleft (intergluteal fold). The treatment depends upon severity of symptoms. Excision with primary closure can be done if there is no evidence of acute infection. If it's infected then excise all tracts and lay flaps to heal by secondary intention. Flap based procedures include Z-plasty, Limberg-flap, Karydakis-flap and Bascom-flap. Ref : Bailey & Love's Sho Practice of Surgery,E25,Page-1239
Hence, the correct answer is D (Rotational flap). (Ref : Bailey and love 26th/e p 1218)
Note - In this case we have multiple answers which could be right but since rotational flap is mentioned specifically so I am going ahead with it.
Also know - Other surgical management techniques includes:

Excision and Primary Closure

This technique involves complete removal of the entire tract followed by immediate closure of the defect using sutures.

The main disadvantage of this method is recurrence due to incomplete drainage of the underlying track.

### Response:
 gans Microscope Objective Lenses The most common magnification power available with an otologic operating microscope is x10-15 (objective lenses). However, higher powers such as x20 can be obtained by using additional eyepieces. In general, lower-power objectives allow more working space than do high-powered ones. For example, when using a x5 objective lens, there will be approximately 6 cm between the front surface of the objective and the stage; this distance decreases to less than 2 cm when using the highest powered objective. A low-magniﬁcation system also allows better illumination of the surgical site because it requires less light intensity at the objective. The ﬁnal image size on the retina depends upon both the objective magniﬀcations and the oculars. Most microscopes have two sets of ocular lenses that may be interchanged. These usually include x8 and x12 ocular pieces. When combined with the objective lenses, these produce total magnifications ranging from x40 to x180. The focal lengths of the various objective lenses vary considerably. Those designed speciﬁcally for otology typically range from 200 to 400 mm. This means that they must be placed very close together if one wishes to obtain"

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
  (A) Azygos vein 
Left Superior Intercostal Vein (LSIV): It is formed by union of 3rd to 5th posterior intercostals veins. It ascends along medial margin of left lung in costomediastinal triangle; it crosses upper border of diaphragm at T8 level & ends by joining ascending pa of Azygos Vein behind right pleura at T4-T5 levels. Right Bronchial Veins drain into LSIV.
Hence, the correct answer is A (AzygOUS vein). The left superior inter-costal vein joins with the ascending aoa to form the azygos system which then continues on to join the vena cava. The hemiazygos and accessory hemia-zygos veins also contribute to this system. The brachio-cephalic veins do not receive blood directly from the inter-costals veins but rather from the internal jugulars and subclavians. Finally, the internal thoracic veins drain into the brachicephalic vein.

Intramaxillary

Interproximal forces that act on teeth within one arch to move them in an occlusoapical direction.
This results in tipping movement of anterior teeth and bodily movement of posterior teeth.
The intramaxillary force system consists of two components:

Primary component – The primary component includes all interdental forces acting between adjacent units such as those produced by class II elastics, rubber bands, springs, etc.

 growth hormone deficiency is associated with sho stature in children but adults may present with symptoms such as decreased muscle mass, increased body fat, reduced exercise tolerance, poor wound healing, loss of subcutaneous tissue over the hands and feet (myxedema), carpal tunnel syndrome, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, sleep apnea, depression, memory problems, and decreased libido. The most common cause of adult-onset growth hormone deficiency due to pituitary disease is surgical resection of a pituituary adenoma. Other causes include radiation therapy directed at the head and neck region during childhood, trauma, infiltrative diseases affecting the hypothalamus and/or pituitaries, Sheehan's syndrome, and sarcoidosis. In addition, some patients who have undergone treatment for acromegaly develop hypopituitarism after surgery, radiotherapy, or medical treatments. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadal women can also be misdiagnosed as having GH deficiency because they often exhibit signs of both sexual infantilism and features of aging secondary to estrogen deficiency.

Recognition of microorganisms by innate immune cells occurs through pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), NOD-like receptors(NLRs), RIG-I like receptors(RLRs) etc.2. The activation of these receptors triggers signaling pathways that lead to production of cytokines which recruit leukocytes into sites of infection3. In addition, some innate immune effector mechanisms can kill microbes directly without the need for adaptive immunity. These include complement-mediated lysis, phagocytosis with intracellular killing in lysosomes, secretion of antimicrobial peptides and lysozyme, and cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells against virus-infected cells.4.

### Response:
 g-Ref Harrison 19th/e p. 1659; KDT 6/h/ e p. I18 (5/e p.l 17)
Hence, the correct answer is C (Increase in mean arterial blood pressure). (But remember that it may also increase heart rate.) Mean aerial pressure is increased due to vasoconstriction caused by noradrenaline. It can cause tachycardia but brady cardia has never been repoed with its use. Noradrenal ine does not affect GFR and hence there will be no change in urine out put.
Hence the correctanswer is C(increase in mean aerail pressure). But keep in mind that you should always go for an agent which increases cardiac output rather than one which causes vaso constriction alone. So if we have to choose between increasing MAP and HR, then we would prefer increasing HR because it means improvement in CO. If both these parameters do not improve after giving catecholamines, then it indicates poor prognosis.

### Response:
  The image shows a Haultain's Retractor (also known as Uterine Elevator). It is used to retract uterus in case of Lower Segment Caesarean Section (LSCS).
Hence, the correct answer is A (L SC S ). (Ref : Dutta Textbook of Obstetrics 7th edition page no 372)
Explanation: The uterine elevator is an instrument that has been designed specifically for elevating the lower segment during cesarean section. This allows better exposure of the upper segment and placenta. Its use may reduce blood loss by decreasing traction on the myometrium at the site of incision. Additionally, it can be useful when there is significant bleeding from the placental implantation site because it provides additional support to the uterus while allowing compression of the uterus with both hands. Ref - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_elevator

### Response:
 g. i.e. (Atropine) (336-Harrison 18th)* The American Heart Association has published guidelines on resuscitation that include recommendations regarding drugs during CPR* In adults with pulseless arrest, epinephrine should be administered every 3-5 minutes.* Epinephrines dose - 1 mg IV push followed by another 0.5mg after 3 min if no return of spontaneous circulation occurs.* If ventricular fibrillation/ tachycardia persists despite three doses of epineprhine, amiodarane may be considered.* Lidocaine can also be used instead of amioderone but it doesnot have an established benefit over amiodorone*** Vasopression is recommended when intravenous access cannot be obtained quickly enough to administer epinepherine**.

### Response:
 ganser syndrome is an organic brain disease that can be caused by severe physical abuse, including beatings to the head, electroshock therapy (ECT), and prolonged sensory deprivation. It has also been linked to hypoglycemia, encephalitis, meningitis, subdural hematomas, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms include confabulation, amnesia, and delusions. Confabulations are false memories that have no basis in reality. They may seem real to the person experiencing them but they do not actually happen. Amnesia refers to memory loss. Delusions refer to beliefs that are based on incorrect information. These three symptoms together create confusion between what really happened and what did not happen. This type of disorder was first described in World War I soldiers who suffered traumatic brain injuries during combat. In some cases, it appears that people with this condition will recover completely after treatment. However, there are many different causes of ganser's syndrome, so recovery rates vary greatly depending upon the underlying cause. Ref Harrison20th edition pgno; 2475

B) Ferrochelatase
C) Porphob I inogen
D) Delta amino levulinic acid
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Heme synthesis occurs in mitochondria and cytosol. The first step in this process involves condensation of succinyl Co A with glycine to form delta-aminolevulenic acid (ALA). ALA then undergoes several reactions before incorporation into protoporphyrins IX. Lead inhibits ferro chelatases which leads to increased levels of porphobilinogens in urine and plasma. It also causes decreased activity of uroporphirinogen decarboxylase leading to excretion of coproporphrinogen III in urine. Ref: Textbook Of Biochemistry By D M Vasudevan, 5th Edition, Page 261; Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th Edition Chapter 48.
Hence, the correct answer is C (PorphobI inogen). (Ref: Text book of biochemistry by DM vasudevan - 5/e p263)
Note : In acute lead poisoning – Urinary porphyrin excretions increase due to increased production of ALA & PBG.
In chronic lead poisoning - Coproporphrylin increases because it cannot be converted to Protoporphyringens.

 g Bone tumors can be divided into two groups based on their histological appearance : Benign bone tumors (e.g., chondroma, fibrous dysplasia, giant cell tumour of bone, haemangioma, aneurysmal bone cyst, simple bone cyst). Malignancies (osteogenic sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma etc.) Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours are rare benign neoplasms that secrete FGF-23 leading to phosphate wasting in kidney with resultant hypophosphatemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The clinical features include osteopenia, rickets/osteomalacia, brown tumours, subperiosteal hematomas, pathological fractures, pain and swelling at site of lesion. Radiologically it appears like lytic lesions which may have sclerotic rim. Treatment is surgical excision of the tumour.

D) By auscultation
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Continuous air bubble formation is seen with endotracheal intubation.
h Auscultation may be used to confirm correct placement but it does not rule out malposition.

In order to verify that the ETT has been correctly placed into trachea, one should perform:

1. Chest radiograph (X-ray)
2. Direct laryngoscopy
3. Infrared light source on the proximal tip of the ET tube
4. Capnography

The most reliable method to determine proper position of the EIT is by direct visualization through direct larygoscopy.
Hence, the correct answer is A (By observing for continous air bubbles comming out of underwater drain). (-Ref : Miller's Anesthesia 8th ed pg- 761).
Note - The above mentioned text was taken from internet which states ""continuous"" air bubbles. But according to miller's anesthesia there is no mention of word ""continuos"". It simply says ""air bubbles"".

C) Pressure controlled
D) SIMV
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 
Explanation: Controlled modes of mechanical ventilation (Controlled Mechanical Ventilation - CMV; Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation- SIMV): In these modes patient has no role in breathing. The ventilator delivers all the tidal volume to the lung at regular intervals. These can lead to alveolar hyperventilation resulting in Respiratory Alkalosis. Assisted Control Mode Ventilation : It is also known as ""Assist-Control"" or simply AC mode. Here too, like controlled modes, the ventilator provides full support by delivering every breath but unlike controlled modes it allows spontaneous respiration between machine delivered breaths. So there will be less chance of developing respiratory alkaloids compared to controlled modes. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) NIV refers to delivery of positive pressure ventilation without an endotracheal tube. This technique may be used instead of conventional intubation and mechanical ventilation when patients require suppoive care that would otherwise necessitate tracheostomy or nasotrachea! intubations. Most common indication for noninvasive ventilation is acute exacerbation of COPD. There is increased risk of respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation during this condition.

In eukaryotic mRNAs, there is an additional structure that helps guide the ribosome onto the mRNA. This consists of a purine-rich region upstream of the cap followed by a pyrimidine rich region called poly-A tract which does not paicipate directly in translation but protects the mRNA from degradation.

Hence, the correct answer is B (Wetting the periphery of the impression with moist cotton to break the peripheral seal). 
Note - If you have read that sudden jerk can be used then don't worry because some authors do mention this method but they also warn us regarding its use. So always go ahead with wetting the borders of the hydrocolloids with water before removing them out of the oral cavity.
Phillips writes – ""Sudden removal may cause tears at the margin of the mucosa or tear away parts of the gingiva.""
Sturdevant writes – “If there is an undercuts present on the model, the impression must be removed slowly and gently by applying pressure over the bulk of the mass rather than attempting to rock the impression off the undercut area.”
So, both these books clearly state that if there is no undercuts available we can try to remove the impression using sudden jerk otherwise slow and gentle movement"

 g. i.v. phenytoin can also be used in status epilepticus if benzodiazepines fail to control seizures. However it has more side effects than barbiturates. It may cause arrhythmias especially when infused too rapidly. Phenytoin infusion must be slowed down if ECG shows widening of QRS complex. The dose of phenytona required to terminate status epileptcus ranges between 15-25 mg/kg with an upper limit of 1 g. Ref Harrison20th edition pg no 2335

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. Answer is A (Supra valvular stenosis) The presence of differential blood pressure between two arms suggests coarctations of aoae but it doesnot explain the presence of an eardiy diastotic murmur at the right second intercostalspace which is suggestive of pulmonary aerial hypeension due to increased resistance against which the RV must pump. Pulmonary hypertension can occur secondary to supravvalvular pulmonic stenoses. Differential Blood Pressure Between Two Arms Suggests Coarction of Aoa But Does Not Explain Presence Of Early Diastolic Murmur At Right Second Intercostal Space This finding is most consistent with either primary pulmonary hypeension or pulmonary hypeensive hea disease. Primary pulmonary hypeensin occurs when there is chronic elevation of mean pulmonary aerial pressure greater than 25mmHg systolic or 10mmHge diastole. It may result from : Chronic thromboembolism Idiopathic Congestive hea failure Systemic diseases such as scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid ahritis, CREST syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon etc. Secondary pulmonary hypeesion results from elevated LV pressures transmitted retrogradely through the pulmonary circulation."

 ggt
Hence, the correct answer is D (GGT). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 18th edition pg 2623-2625 table 355-1.)The most sensitive test to detect alcohol abuse in patients with liver disease is gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), which has been shown to be elevated in up to 90% of individuals who consume more than 80 g/d of ethanol.Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) may also be increased but is less specific because it can be raised by many causes of acute hepatocellular injury.AST levels tend to rise later after an episode of binge drinking and therefore have limited value in detecting recent heavy drinking.Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GCT/GGT):Gamma glutamyl transferase (gamma GT) is an enzyme found throughout the body that helps break down amino acids.Its level increases when there is damage to cells in the bile ducts within the liver.The main cause of high GGt levels is excessive consumption of alcohol.However, this marker does not specifically indicate alcoholism; rather, it indicates some form of liver cell stress.In addition to alcohol use, several conditions increase gamma GT levels including gallstones,"

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. The vitamin K cycle involves reduction of oxidized vitamin K (K epoxide) to reduced vitamin K by an NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxygenase called VKORC1 (vitamin K epoxide reeductase complex-1). This reaction requires two molecules of NADP(H), one molecule of O2, and water. In this way, it consumes reducing equivalents that could be used elsewhere in metabolism. Reduced vitamin K then reacts with glutamyl residues on blood clotting factors II, VII, IX, X, prothrombin, protein C, and protein S to produce gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla).
Hence, the correct answer is D (Epoxide re ductase). (but note - actually there is no such enzyme named ""epoxide re dcutase"" but rather ""Vitamine k epoxide reduc tase"". But still we have to mark some option out of these four)
Hence the correctanswer is D ((Epoxide red uctase)). (but remember - Vitamine k epxide Reductase Complex I (VKORCI) is the actual name of the enzyme involved in regeneration of vitamine k ).(Ref: Harper's Illustrated Bio"

### Response:
  
Explanation: Ans is c i.e. measles, Booster dose of dpt & opv The child in this case has already been vaccinated with first dose of DTp (not DPT), so he needs to receive second dose of same vaccine alongwith measles vaccination. As far as OPV is concerned, it should also be continued till completion of primary course which includes three doses. So, we need to give him third dose of OPV too. Now lets see what happens if there was no error in giving DPT instead of DT p? In that case, the answer would have been different because then the child had completed his full series of DTP vaccinations and needed only measles vaccination.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Measles, booster dose o f DPT an dOP V). (-a). (Ref : Park's Textbook of PSM 22nd /e p- 140)

### Response:
 g. (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th edition, Page 1193)* Heparin can be administered by intravenous bolus injection to achieve rapid anticoagulation in patients with acute coronary syndrome.* It may also be infused continuously at a constant rate using an infusion pump* For prophylactic use it is usually injected subcutaneously once daily.* The most common adverse effect associated with heparins is bleeding; however, osteoporosis has been reported after long-term therapy with unfractionated heparine.
Hence, the correct answer is A (Subcutaneous). (Ref:Harrison's Principles Of Internal Medicine-18th Edition,Page : 1192, Table 121-1.).(Ref: Katzung Pharmacology 12th Ed P: 620).
Explanation: * Unfractioned heparan is available as sodium salt & calcium salt - both have same efficacy but different duration of action. Sodium salts last longer than calcium salts because they dissociate more slowly. * LMW heparans do not require monitoring. They don't cross placenta so safe during pregnancy.

### Response:
 g B (Decrease in pre-load) Ref: Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 12th ed.Explanation: NITRATESNitrates act by releasing nitric oxide which activates guanylyl cyclase to increase cGMP levels.Nitrate therapy has three major effects on cardiovascular system:- It decreases preload- It causes venous dilation - it increases total blood volume but reduces effective circulating volume.- It also dilates coronary vessels - improves myocardial oxygen supply.Inhibition of platelet adhesion and aggregation may be an additional effect of NO produced by organic nitrateresults in decreased peripheral resistance and increased cardiac output.The most important therapeutic use of niteric compounds is in the treatment of ischemic heart disease especially chronic stable angina pectoris.They have no role in unstable angina because they do not affect sympathetic tone and therefore cannot prevent sudden attacks of anginal pain.Adenosine produces similar hemodynamic changes like that of nitsrates but its primary site of action is at AV node where it slows conduction velocity without affecting atrial contraction.It can cause hypotension due to reflex tachycardia.

### Response:
 g
Hence, the correct answer is A (HbsAg). (Ref: Ananthanarayan 8th/512-513; Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th edition, chapter 310)
Hepatitis B virus has three major antigens:

HBs Ag - surface antigen
Hbe Ag - e Antigen
Hbc Ag - core antigen

The antibodies produced against these antigens are :

Anti HBc Ab - Core antibody
Anti-HBs Ab - Surface Antibody
Anti HBe Ab - E antibody.

In acute hepatitis B infection, all four components can be detected in serum :-

1. HBV DNA,
2. HBCag,
3. Antibodies to HBCag (IgM),
4. Surface antigen (HBsAg).

During chronic infections, HBV-DNA and HBsAg persist but anti-HBCag disappears.
Hence,

Option ‘a’ i.e., Hbs Ag is the marker which will increase during an active Hepatitis-B infection.
Option ‘b’, ‘d’ & ‘e’ are incorrect because they do not appear until after the disappearance of HBs Ag.

### Response:
 g C i.e., Shaft
Hence, the correct answer is C (Shaft). (Ref: Apley's System of Orthopaedics & Fractures - 9th edn / 1013)
March fractures occur most commonly at the junction between the diaphysis and metaphysis of one of the long bones of the foot, usually the second through fifth metatarsalsQ.
The mechanism of injury involves repetitive stress on an already weakened bone that has been subjected to increased load due to abnormal biomechanics such as overpronation or supination.
It can be treated conservatively with rest, ice, compression, elevation, bracing, physical therapy, and pain management.
Surgical treatment may include internal fixation using plates, screws, intramedullary nails, external fixators, or percutaneous pinning.
Hence it is important to know which part of the 2""d metatarsel is affected by march fracture.
Explanation : The shaft of the second metatarsl is the commonest site for this type of fatigue fractureQ.

Frey’s Syndrome

It occurs due to damage to sympathetic innervation of sweat glands over parotid bed after surgical removal of part of parotids.

Symptoms occur several months after operation when patient eats spicy food; there will be sweating and flushing over parotidectomy site and sometimes even over angle of mouth and cheek.
This is because of aberrant regeneration of parasyomatic fibers that normally supply the salivay gland now supplies the skin resulting in gustatovisceral reflex.

 g. (a) 2nd National Leprosy Eradication Programme Review Meeting was held in New Delhi during 16-18th February, 2005. The meeting reviewed progress made since launch of NLEP in April 2003; discussed issues related to implementation of programme strategies & action plan for achieving elimination by end of year 2006. It also decided upon indicators which would be used to monitor achievement of goals set under NLEPR. These include prevalence rates, annual new case detections, treatment completion rates etc. As per latest available data up-to 31"" march 2015, India has achieved an incidence rate of less than one case per 100,000 mid-year population. This means that we have already met our goal of reducing the disease burden below one case/million population at national level. Prevalence rate stands at 0·67 cases per 10, 000 population. Thus, it can be said that India will achieve its target of eliminating lepropsy as a public health problem by end 2018.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g C (Rectum) : The rectosigmoid area of the colon has been shown to be an excellent location for measuring body core temperatures because it closely approximates central venous blood temperature. It also provides good accessibility in all patients undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia. Intraoperative hypothermia can occur with even mild environmental cooling (<20degC). Hypothermic cardiac surgical procedures have been associated with increased post operative complications such as myocardial ischemia, coagulopathy, infection, prolonged hospitalization, and higher costs. Therefore, maintaining normothemia intraoperatively is impoant. Core temperature should be measured at least once per hour using either nasopharyngeal or bladder catheters. If there is no access to these sites, then skin surface measurements may be used. However, this method does not accurately reflect true core temperature. Skin surface warming devices include forced-air blankets, circulating water mattresses, radiant warmers, and heated intravenous fluids. Forced air blankets are probably the most effective device available. They work by blowing warmed air over the patient's exposed areas. Circulating water mattresses use heat exchangers that circulate warmed fluid through plastic tubing placed within the mattress. Radiant warmer lamps direct infrared radiation onto the patient.

### Response:
 g
Hence, the correct answer is B (Ferropoin). (Ref : Harper's illustrated biochemistry 30th edition page no- 621 table 50-1 ). The ferroportins are iron export proteins that regulate plasma iron levels in mammals. They mediate basolateral efflux of Fe2+ out of duodenal enterocytes into blood plasma. In addition to regulating dietary iron absorption, they also control mobilization of stored body iron during periods of negative iron balance. A mutation in SLC40A1 causes hereditary haemochromatosis type IV, which results in increased intestinal uptake of dietary iron with consequent tissue damage due to excessive accumulation of iron..
Hence,
The final answer is C (Hephaestine). (REF: GUYTON AND HALL TEXTBOOK OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY 12TH EDITION PAGE NO - 1015)
Explanation: Transpoers involved in iron metabolism include:

### Response:
 g Anesthesia in patient with multiple sclerosis is challenging because it can exacerbate symptoms by increasing temperature (spinal cord edema), altering blood flow, and causing demyelination. The most common presenting symptom is visual loss due to optic neuritis. Other frequent complaints include weakness, paresthesias, bladder dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, pain, cognitive impairment, depression, and ataxia. In general, patients should avoid hyperthermia during labor and vaginal delivery. Regional anesthetics may cause autonomic dysreflexia if used below T6 level. However, epidural analgesic techniques have been shown to decrease sympathetic outflow without inducing hypotension. Epidural bupivacaine has also been found to reduce fever in women undergoing cesarean section compared with intravenous fentanyl. Therefore, regional anesthesia remains the preferred method of pain relief in these cases. Ref: Butterwoh IV J.F., Mackey D.C., Wasnick J.D. (2013). Chapter 44.

Hence, the correct answer is B (Bradycardial with AV blockade). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th edition, Page 1965)
The combination of beta-blockers and calcium channel antagonists has been associated with an increased risk of hea failure due to their additive negative ionotropic effects. The concomitant use of these two classes of drugs also increases the incidence of symptomatic hypotension and bradyarrhythmias. Therefore, they must be used cautiously when administered together; however, such combinations have become more common because both types of agents reduce cardiovascular morbidity and moality in patients at high cardiac risk.

### Response:
 g. Ultrasound is most sensitive test in early first trimester (5-7 weeks). It can detect embryonic cardiac activity by 6th week. The absence of embryo with cardiac activity beyond this time indicates an abnormal pregnancy. Transvaginal ultrasound has greater sensitivity than transabdominal scan because it allows better visualization of intrauterine contents earlier in pregnancy. However, TVS may be technically difficult if there is poor pelvic anatomy, large fibroid distoing the endometrial cavity or when patient cannot tolerate probe placement. In such cases abdominal sonography should be used instead. Ref : Dutta book of obstetrics 8th Ed.
Hence, the correct answer is B (USG for focal cardiac activity). (-). (Ref: Williams Obs 25/e p 108; DC Duttas Textbook Of Obstetrics 9e pg - 53)

### Response:
 g. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is an impoant factor in mobilization of dietary iron by reducing ferric to ferrous form which can be absorbed more easily than Fe3+. It also enhances nonheme iron absorption. The presence of phytates, phosphates, carbonated beverages, tea etc., inhibit iron absorption.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Vitamin C). (Ref: Textbook of Biochemistry D M Vasudevan 6th edition page no 126)
The most important function of vitamin C is that it acts as a coenzyme for hydroxylation reactions such as proline hydroxylase involved in collagen synthesis. In addition, it has antioxidant activity; reduces oxidized glutathione; helps maintain reduced state of pyridine nucleotides; aids in conversion of folic acid into active folinic acid; promotes intestinal absorption of non-haem iron; and maintains integrity of capillaries and small blood vessels.

### Response:
 growth pattern of paranasal sinuses

Maxillary - starts developing at birth & reaches its full size by puberty (12-14 years).
Ethmoids - starts developing in utero & reach their maximum development during adolescence.
Frontal - begins to develop after 2nd year of life & attains maturity between 20-25 yrs.
Sphenoidal - develops late & continues growing until middle age.

So, frontal sinus is last one to grow & stops growth in early adulthood.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Frontal). (Ref: Diseases of ENT, PL Dhingra, 6th edition, pg no. 210)
The image shows CT scan showing pneumatization of frontal sinus which can be seen on both sides of nasal cavity above orbit.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Oxygen is used to saturate the Fio2 in alveoli prior to induction of anaesthesia (preoxygenation). The time taken depends on several factors like minute ventilation, tidal volume, respiratory rate, cardiac output, lung function etc. It takes approximately 3 minutes to achieve an oxygen saturation >90% in blood returning to hea after one minute. This is called ""denitrogenation"" process. Preoxygenating with 100% O2 at flow rates of 10 L/min can raise PaO2 to more than 500 mmHg within three minutes. In patients who have rapid shallow breathing pattern, it may take longer to reach this level. If patient has poor pulmonary reserve, then even 6-8 mins will be needed to get adequate levels of oxygen in blood stream. So, minimum recommended duration of preoxygenatoin is 3 mins. Ref : Miller's anesthesia 7th/e p 1019
Hence, the correct answer is A (3 min). (Ref: Miller's Anesthesia 7/e p1020; Morgan & Mikhail's Clinical Anaesthesiology 5/e p108)

D) Hot and Humidification of air
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g D i.e., (Hot & humidification of Air) (410 - Lee's synopsis of Anaesthesia 13th)* High flow nasal canulas deliver heated and humidified gas at flows >50 L/min* Nasopharynx has no significant resistance to airflow in adults but it does have some capacitance.* The volume of this ""dead"" space is approximately 20 ml/kg body weight. Therefore, if you were breathing room air with tidal volumes of 500-600 mL, then your first breath would be wasted on filling up the naso pharynx rather than getting into alveoli*** In children, who may require higher minute ventilation, these losses become more clinically important and so they benefit most from using a high-flow system**. However, even in adult patients, there will still be benefits because the total amount of fresh gas required per minute is reduced by bypassing the nasopharvyngeal deadspace*** It also decreases work of respiration and reduces respiratory rate which helps in decreasing CO2 production and thus reducing hyperventilation syndrome*** There is no evidence that high flow nasal therapy improves lung function or increases PaO2 levels compared to low flow systems*** Intermittent positive pressure ventillation (IPPV), continuous positive air"

Non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours account for approximately one-third to half of all pancreatic NETs.

Insulinomas 

These are most commonly functioning pancreatic endocrine neoplasms.
They arise within the body and tail of the gland because these areas have more blood supply than head of the pancrease.
The symptoms include postprandial hypoglycemia with sweating, tremor, hunger, weakness, confusion, dizziness, anxiety, palpitation etc.
Diagnosis can be made using fasting test i.e., patient should fast until symptoms occur or serum glucose <40mg/dl whichever occurs first.
Treatment includes surgical resection which may involve enucleation or distal pancreatectomy depending on location of insulinoma.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. The pneumococcus is one of the most common causes of acute otitis media (affecting children between two months to three years), pneumonia, meningitis and septic arthritis. It can also cause bronchitis, sinusitis, otosclerosis and glomerulonephritis. Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae may be asymptomatic but it often presents as lobar pneumonia. Treatment is penicillin G or amoxicillin; if there is resistance then vancomycin should be used. Prophylaxis against recurrent infections due to this organism includes vaccination with polyvalent pneumococci vaccine every six months. This reduces morbidity by 50-90% and mortality by 30%. 
Hence, the correct answer is D (Recurrent otitis Media and Sinusitis). (Ref: Textbook of Microbiology Baveja 5th edition page no. 214)

Light Transmitting Wedge

It consists of two parts:

1. Base plate with holes to receive pins on denture base.

2. Wedge portion which has an opening in it that allows passage of light through the pin hole onto gingiva.

The wedge can be made up of metal or plastic material. The amount of transmitted light depends upon size of openings in both the base plate & the wedge. A typical design transmits 80 – 85 % of incident illumination.
Hence the correct choice here is B i,e. 80 — 85%ofincidntlight.

Hence, the correct answer is C (Intramaxillary). (Ref: Orthodontics: Diagnosis & Management of Malocclusion & Dentofacial Deformities - Shafiq Qureshi; 3rd ed pg- 8)
Types of Anchorage in Orthodontic Treatment

Intermaxillary (Reciprocal): It involves use of both jaws to produce force on teeth. The maxilla acts as an anchor unit while mandible moves against it. This type of anchorage can be used when there is no need to move molars distally because they have already moved into their final position.

Intramaxillary: When one half of dental arch is anchored with fixed appliance and the other part is treated by removable appliances such as headgear, this is called intramixillary anchoring. For example, if upper anterior segment has been proclined due to excessive incisor display during smiling, then treatment would involve retraction of these teeth using fixed orthodontic brackets along with application of extra oral traction through head gear which anchors the posterior segments of dentition. Thus, intermoxillary anchorege refers to the relationship between two"

Which of the following could be used to determine the distance from which the weapon was fired?
Options:
A) Hair
B) Clothes
C) Bullet fragments
D) Blood
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
  
Explanation: The presence of tattooing (imprint of gun powder grains), blackening (gunshot residue) and abrasion collar indicate that shot has been fired within close range (<10 cms). Bevelling is seen when the skin is struck tangentially by the missile. It indicates direction of injury. In this case since bevelling is present both at entrance & exit wounds it means that victim must have been standing facing the assailant. Distance between muzzle end of firearm and body can be calculated using formula : d = r + l where d=distance; r=radius of expanding gas cloud formed after firing; l=length of projectile Ref: Textbook of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology By Nagesh Kumar Rao page 162-3.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Bullet fragments). (Ref: Text book of Forensics - Dr K S Narayan Reddy - 21st Ed)
Note: Tattooing occurs due to deposition of unburnt particles of explosive substance along with paicles of lead into the abraded surface of skin. Blackening is caused by carbon paicles deposited over the skin. Both these occur upto a distance of 40cms from the muzzle end. Beyond this they do not appear because gases lose their velocity"

### Response:
 g Blood stored in citrate phosphate dextrose (CPD) is an effective anticoagulant because of its high concentration of sodium citrate. Citrate binds to calcium with such tenacity that it must be removed before the blood can clot. The citric acid cycle requires large amounts of oxaloacetate; therefore, when citrate accumulates in excess, it inhibits this pathway. This inhibition leads to decreased production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which results in lactic acid accumulation. In addition, CPD causes hypocalcemia by chelating free ionized calcium. Hypocalcemic patients may have tetany, carpopedal spasm, and seizures. Calcium gluconate infusions will correct these symptoms. Because lactate has been shown to cause metabolic acidosis, some centers now use adenine-adenosine-phosphates (AASOL) instead of CPD. AASOL does not produce significant quantities of lactate during storage. It also contains more than twice the amount of potassium found in fresh frozen plasma.

### Response:
 g B i.e., Zone of Infection
Hence, the correct answer is B (Zone of infection). (Ref: Textbook of microbiology by Ananthanarayan & Paniker 8th/ p. 6)
The zone around an infecting organism where its products have toxic effects on host cells is called ""zone of infection"".
It contains bactericidin toxins that kill bacteria but do not stimulate their growth.
In this area there will be marked inflammatory reaction with infiltration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes.
This zone may extend up to several millimeters into surrounding tissues depending upon virulence of organisms involved and resistance of tissue cells.

Also know:

- The zone immediately adjacent to the zone of infection is known as ""zone of invasion"" which has been defined as the region between the invading microorganism and the zone of infection.
- It extends over a distance equal to diameter of cell within which the pathogen can invade the cell without encountering obstacles such as mucus layer covering respiratory epithelium etc.
- This zone does not show much inflammation because it represents the site of interaction between host cells and pathogens.
- However, if the pathogenicity of agent is high enough, some degree of cellular damage occurs resulting in mild inflammatory"

### Response:
 g. The most common cause of anovulation is hyperprolacticnemia which can be caused by prolactin secreting pituitary adenoma (microadenomas). Bromocripticne inhibits Prolactin secretion and thus used in treatment of this condition. Other drugs that inhibit lactation include cabergoline, metaclopramide, domperidone, sulpiride, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, pimozide, thioridazone, risperidon, olanzapine, quetiapine and clozapine. Drugs causing galactorrhea due to D2 receptor blockade are ergot alkaloids like ergotoxine, dihydroergotoxines, methylergonovine, ergometrine, ergonovine etc. Dopamine agonists such as apomorphine also have similar action.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g A (Nucleus Caudalis)> The nucleus caudais is located in the dorsal horn of the medulla oblongata and receives input from nociceptors that innervate skin and mucous membranes. It projects to several areas including the thalamus, hypothalamus and brainstem reticular formation. Pain sensation is relayed through this pathway to higher centers where it can be perceived by conscious awareness. This area also has visceral sensory fibers coming into it. Fibers from the trigeminal nerve enter here before going on to their final destination in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamic complex. The limbic system is involved with emotions such as fear and anger but does not receive direct pain inputs. The superior cervical ganglia contain postganglionic sympathetic neurons whose cell bodies reside within them. These cells project out of these ganglia along branches of the carotid plexuses to supply blood vessels and sweat glands of the head and neck. They do not carry somatic sensations like pain. The reticular activating system consists of nuclei in the midbrain tegmentum, pontine tegmenta, and upper pa of the medial medullary pyramids. Stimulation of this region produces arousal and wakefulness;"

### Response:
 g The first sign of dental tissue formation is seen in the ectoderm at the end of fourth week (i.e., during the period of organogenesis).
Hence, the correct answer is D (4th Week). (Ref: Textbook of Oral Histology by SO Asma; 7th ed page no 10)
Note: The earliest evidence of enamel formation occurs between 5-6 weeks after fertilization when ameloblasts begin to form the innermost layer of enamel on the crown surface of deciduous teeth.
Hence it can be said that Initial tooth development starts around 4 - 6 weeks post-fertilisation.

D) Wound swab–culture and sensitivity
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g B i.e., Urine-culture & sensitivity
Hence, the correct answer is B (Urine–cultureand sensitivity). Explained text : Meningo-myelocoele occurs when there is incomplete closure of neural tube during embryonic development. It contains CSF which may be sterile or infected. Infection in meningo myelocole can occur either by direct extension from an overlying wound infection or through urinary tract infections. So urine culture should always be done to rule out UTI before treating with antibiotics.
Hence infants with meningomylaceloe should have their urine cultured prior to commencing antibiotic therapy. This will help prevent unnecessary use of broad spectrum antibiotics that promote growth of resistant organisms such as MRSA.
Remember - Culture of rectum or stool does not give information regarding presence of infection within the sac because it is derived from outside environment.
Culture of blood and wound swabs do not yield positive results since they represent contamination from the external environment.
So, among all these tests, urine culture gives maximum diagnostic value.

### Response:
 g Ans. (a) General anaesthesia with IV Induction by KetamineRef : Morgan's Anaesthesiology at a Glance 5th ed./p-55* In case of hypotension during spinal anesthesia we can give vasopressors like ephedrine.* But here since it is an emergency situation where time is very crucial, general anesthesia would be preferred over spinal anesthesia.* For induction of GA in such cases ketamine should be used because it increases heart rate and BP due to sympathetic stimulation.* Propofol decreases both HR & BP so contraindicated in this scenario.
Hence, the correct answer is A (General anesthesia with II induction by keta...). (Ref: Morgan's Anesthesiology At A Glance - p55)

 g D i.e., After delivery Anti - D immunoglobulin should be administered after delivery in Rh negative women who have been sensitized by an ABO compatible fetusQ (eg, if mother has had prior pregnancy with child of different blood group). It can also be given at 26-30 week's gestation when there is evidence that fetal red cells have crossed into maternal circulation eg, elevated indirect Coombs testQ. The dose used depends on whether it is being given before or after 20th week of gestation. Before 20 weeks, 300 microgram IM is sufficient while after 21st week, 1 unit/5 kg body weight is required. This must be repeated every four weeks until term. If bleeding occurs during antepaum period, then this drug should be injected within 72 hours. In case of postpaum hemorrhage, it should be infused within 3 days.

 g A (Isomorphic R.B.C.) (Ref: Nelson's 20th/ p. 2563-65; Ghai 8/e p.463-465)The presence of calcium oxalate crystals in urine suggests that there may be an underlying metabolic abnormality such as idiopathic hypercalcemia, primary hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis, vitamin D intoxication, milk alkali syndrome, bariatric surgery, thiazide diuretics etc., which can lead to nephrolithiasis.Nephrologists use the term ""hypercalciuric"" when referring to patients who excrete more than 250 mg/d of Ca2+ in their urine.The clinical presentation depends on whether stones form in the kidney or lower urinary tract.Urinary calculi composed primarily of calcium account for approximately 80% of all renal stone disease.In children, however, uric acid stones are more common.Most calcium-containing stones contain both calcium oxlate and hydroxyapatite.Patients typically present with flank pain radiating to the groin, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, and sometimes hematur ia.Hematuria occurs because of bleeding into the collecting system secondary to trauma caused by passage of the stone through the ureter"

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 
Explanation: Ans. A. Estrogensa. Theca cells produce androstenedione under stimulation by FSH.b. Granulosa cells convert this to estradiol with aromatase.c. Estradiol stimulates growth of endometrium.d. After ovulation, progesterone produced by corpus luteum maintains pregnancy.e. If no fertilization occurs, corpus luceurn degenerates into corpus albicans.f. This leads to decrease in estrogen production.g. Endometrial shedding (menses) occurs due to lack of hormonal support.h. Thus, before ovulation - estrogeni; after ovulation- progesteronel.
Hence, the correct answer is A (Estrogen). (Ref: Textbook of Obstetrics D.C.Dutta 6th Ed Page 55)
This text has been taken from Textbook of obstetrics Dutta 7th ed page 56
Also Know:

Theca interna cells secrete androstendione which gets converted to estriol by granulosal cells.
FSH causes proliferation of these cells.
LH increases their sensitivity to androsteneodine.

Note: In follicular phase, there is positive feedback of estrogen on pituitary leading to increased secretion"

Hence it is important to have adequate fluid intake in order to prevent uremia.
The dietary recommendations for chronic kidney disease include:

1. Adequate protein intake

Protein restriction may be required if GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2.

2. Salt restriction

Salt restriction reduces blood pressure and slows progression of renal failure.

3. Potassium restriction

Potassium excretion by kidneys decreases with worsening renal function. Dietary potassium restriction helps control hyperkalemia.

4. Phosphate restriction

Phosphorus binds calcium and promotes secondary hyperparathyroidism. Restriction of phosphorous rich foods such as meat, dairy products etc. can help reduce serum phosphate levels.

5. Calcium supplementation

Calcium supplements should be taken at bedtime because they interfere with absorption of iron and zinc during meals.

6. Vitamin D supplement

Causes - 

1. Prematurity
2. Cesarean sections
3. Large baby
4. Maternal diabetes
5. Postmature babies
6. Bih injury during difficult deliveries
7. Congenital heart disease


Clinical features -

The infant presents with respiratory distress within first few hours of life. The chest X-ray shows interstitial emphysema, pleural effusion & upper lobe infiltrates.


Treatment -
Supportive treatment with oxygen therapy and monitoring of vital parameters.
Most infants recover spontaneously by 48-72 hrs.
If there is no improvement, antibiotics should be started.
Intraventricular hemorrhage can occur if it persists beyond 96 hrs.

### Response:
 g C i.e., Hypoglossofus Olfactory sensation (smell) is carried by I cranial nerveQ through olfactory tract to ipsilateral olfactory coex of frontal lobe & contralateral olfactory bulb. Smells are processed in piriform area of temporal lobes. Gustatory sensations (taste) are carried by facial (VII), glossopharyn- geal (IX), vagus (X) & hypoglossa! (12th) nerves; taste fibers pass through nucleus solitarius to thalamus & then to parietal lobe.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Hypoglossol). (Ref: Vishram Singh textbook of clinical neuroanatomy second edition pg - 55)
Olfaction occurs due to stimulation of olfactory receptors located on the surface of the nasal mucosa. The axons of these sensory neurons form the olfactory nerve which passes through cribriform plate into the olfacto ry b ulb. From there it reaches the primary olfactory cortex in the uncus of medial temporal lobe. Fibers from this region project to orbitofrontal coex where perception of smell takes place.

 ganser syndrome is an example of dissociative disorder in which there is clouding of consciousness with confabulation (i.e., filling gaps in memory by making up information that never happened). It can be seen after severe physical abuse, head trauma, infection, or even starvation. The patient may also have visual hallucinations, delusions, and catatonic behavior. Treatment includes benzodiazepines to reduce anxiety and antipsychotics if psychotic symptoms occur. Ref - Harrison's internal medicine 20e pg 1115, pubmed.com

### Response:
 g. The diagnosis is preeclampsia. It should be managed by admitting the patient to hospital, starting magnesium sulphate prophylaxis and terminating the pregnancy at 34-37 weeks. Oral antihypterensive drugs have no role in management of severe pre-eclampsiae.
Hence, the correct answer is C (Admit the patent, start anti-hypertenstics, MgS04 and terminate tne pregnancy). (-). (Ref: Williams Obstetrics 23rd edition Page 1000)
The American College of obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that all women who develop new-onset high blood pressure during pregnancy receive treatment aimed at lowering their diastolic blood pressure to less than 110mmHg. This can usually be achieved using labetalol, which has been shown to reduce maternal morbidity without increasing perinatal mortality rates. Magnesium sulfate remains the drug of choice for seizure prevention in patients with eclampsia; it also may lower both systolic and diastole pressures. However, its use does not improve fetal outcomes compared with placebo. In addition, there is evidence suggesting an increased risk of cerebral edema when used concomitantly with beta blockers such as labetalal. Therefore,"

### Response:
 gives rise to palatal grooves which may be continuous with the gingival sulcus of maxillary teeth. These grooves can extend onto crown surface giving appearance of fissures (palatoginigual grooves). This feature helps in distinguishing between natural fissure and restoration on occlusal surface of upper molars.
Hence, the correct answer is D (Maxillary first premier). (Ref: Textbook of ORAL PATHOLOGY - Shafer's 7th edition page no 55)
 
Palatoginguival Groove

It is an anatomical variation that occurs when there is a shallow depression present along the lingual aspect of the tooth. It appears like a small cleft-like structure extending from the cervical third into the middle third of the crown.

Causes:

The cause of this condition has been attributed to incomplete fusion of two dental lamina during embryonic development. The resulting defect gives rise to a shallow groove that extends from the cervix towards the incisal edge of the anterior teeth and from the mesial line angle toward the distobuccal line angle of posterior teeth.

Clinical Significance:

This groove should not be confused with caries lesions because it does not have a sharp demarcation at its base."

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 greatest supply to nose comes from sphenopalantine aery which is a terminal branch of maxillary aery.other branches include posterior ethmiodal,anterior ethmoida,later alseptal,aerial supply also occurs through internal carotids (ref BDC volume3,sixth edition pg no 280)
Hence, the correct answer is C (superior labial). (Ref: BD Chaurasia's HUMAN ANATOMY Vol.1 6th Edition page no-272).
The blood supply to the nasal cavity includes both the internal and external carotic systems. The major source of arterial blood is the ophthalmic artery, an inferior division of the internal carotic system. Other sources of blood in this region include the sphenoplatine aery, a terminal branceh of the maxillary Aery; the greater palatin aeries, which arise from the descending palatines; and the anteriror and posterior ethmoidals, which originate from the ophthalamic aery.

### Response:
 g. 5 HT-4 agonists - Mosapride, prucallopide, tegaserod (used in constipation)
Hence, the correct answer is A (5HT3/4 agonant). (Ref : KDT 6/e p101; Katzung 10/e p108). Note that there was no mention of 5-HT3 receptor involvement in this drug. So we have to go with 5-Ht4 agonism.
Hence it is option A (i.e., 5TH4 agonisnt), which is the most appropriate choice here.
Explanation: Ref-Katzung 11th ed.Pg 107

### Response:
 g C i.e., Metal coping with high stiffness 
Hence, the correct answer is C (Metal coping with High Stiffness). (Ref: Textbook of prosthodontics by Sridhar Premkumar 2nd edition page no 210)
The metal framework should be stiff enough to withstand occlusal forces without distoion. The thickness of the framework will depend on its location within the denture base; it must be thicker at the anterior than posterior regions because of greater stress concentration here due to lip pressure. A minimum wall thickness of 0.5 mm is recommended for all areas except incisive edges where it may have to be increased up to 1mm depending upon the type of material used. In addition, the shape of the internal surface of the metal framework also plays an important role in determining rigidity. For example, if there is a sharp angle between two arms of the frame work, then this area becomes weak compared to one having smooth curves. Therefore, whenever possible, such angles should be avoided. If they cannot be eliminated altogether, they can be reinforced by adding additional support either by soldering more metal into that region or by using plastic splints. It has been found that when the ratio of length to width"

### Response:
 ganser syndrome (also known as pseudodementia, hysterical dementia, or koala bear syndrome) is a condition in which patients present with symptoms similar to those of organic brain disease such as memory loss, confusion, disorientation, poor concentration, hallucinations, delusions, and catatonic behavior.[1] It was first described by German psychiatrist Hecker in 1871[2][3]. The term ""Ganser's syndrome"" has been used since at least 1900,[4] but it gained popularity after World War II when many prisoners of war were found to have developed this disorder while being held captive. Ganser also noted that some people who had suffered head trauma would develop these same symptoms; he called them imitators because they mimicked the signs and symptoms of neurological disorders. In addition, there may be an association between Gansers' syndrome and dissociative fugue states. Dissociation refers to a disruption in consciousness, identity, motor control, perception, cognition, memory, and/or sensory input. This can result in depersonalization, derealisation, amnesia, and multiple identities. Fugues refer specifically to episodes where one loses all personal history and assumes another identity.

 g. The Integrated Management of Neonatal & Childhood Illness (IMNC1) is an evidence based approach that aims at reducing morbidity & moality in children under age of five years by improving quality of care provided during routine visits to health facilities. It was launched on 2nd October 1999. IMNCI includes training of front line workers such as Anganwadi worker/ ASHA / Dais etc. who refer sick children to sub-centres where they receive appropriate treatment. In case of severe illness, referral to PHCs/DHs takes place. Under Janani Suraksha Yojna (JSY), pregnant women including those delivering in government health institutions will be entitled to cash assistance upto Rs.1000/- towards delivery expenses. This scheme covers all states except Delhi. Under JSY, there is provision for free transport facility up to nearest public institution having obstetric services.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Option b i.e., Serum protein Calcium levels below 7-8mg% can be seen in hypoproteinemia (low albumin). So if we give extra calcium without knowing whether it's due to low albumin or true hypocalcemia, there will be risk of hypercalcemia. Therefore, first check out the total protein concentration of blood.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Serum protein). Explained above.
Hypocalcaemic tetany may occur during anaesthesia because of administration of citrated blood products or anticoagulants used for cardiopulmonary bypass, rapid repletion of calcium stores after prolonged fasting, sepsis, pancreatitis, burns, liver failure, renal insufficiency, vitamin D deficiency, hypomagnesaemia, alkalosis, and postoperative pain. Hyperventilation with high fresh gas flows also causes respiratory alkalosis which leads to hypocalcaemia by reducing ionized calcium concentrations through an increase in plasma proteins binding capacity. In addition, patients who have been on mechanical ventilation prior to induction should receive additional calcium supplementation.

 g B i.e., Immediate Tracheotomy
Hence, the correct answer is B (Immediate tracheastomy). The most common cause of airway obstruction in patients with advanced cancer of larynxx is subglottic stenosisQ. In such cases emergency tracheal intubation may be difficult or impossible because of tumor infiltration into the glottis & supraglottis region. Emergency cricothyrotomy can be done but it has its own complications like perichondritis, hemorrhage etc. So immediate tracheaestomy should be performed.
Hence immediate trachyostomy is required in this case.

Hence, the correct answer is C (Estradiol). (Ref: Textbook of Obstetrics D.C.Dutta 6th edition page no- 53).
Quadruple screening includes measurement of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), inhibin-A, and unconjugate estrone (UE3). The triple-screen tests include these four analytes except UE3. These screens have sensitivities ranging between 60% to 80%. Sensitivity increases with advancing gestational age but decreases if performed before 13 weeks' gestation. Specificity ranges from 95% to greater than 99%.
The quad-screen has been shown to be more sensitive than the triple-screen when compared at similar specificities. However, it also results in an increased false-positive rate because of its lower specificity. Therefore, the quad-screen should probably be reserved for patients who desire additional information after receiving abnormal results on the triple-test panel.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Organophosphates (Tik-20), carbamates (Baygon) and anticholinesterase drugs can be treated with atropinization. However endrin poisoning requires no specific treatment except symptomatic suppo.
Hence, the correct answer is B (Endrin). (Ref: The Essentials of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology by KS Narayan Reddy, 29th edition, Page 512)
Atropine has been used to treat organophosphate insecticide poisonings because it competes with acetylcholine for binding sites on muscarinic receptors; however, its use may have adverse effects such as tachycardia, mydriasis, dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, constipation, confusion, delirium, hallucinations, hyperthermia, and seizures. It does not reverse nicotinic receptor overstimulation caused by excessive ACh levels. In addition, atropine will exacerbate neuromuscular blockade if administered concurrently with neostigmine. Oximes, which reactivate phosphorylated cholinesterases, do not appear to improve outcomes but remain standard therapy due to their low toxicity.

Options:
A) Low validity, low reliability
B) High validity, low reliability
C) High validity, high reliability
D) Low validity, high reliability
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
  - Validity refers to what extent an instrument measures which it purports to measure i.e., degree to which test accurately measures the attribute that is being studied in this case haemoglobin level. Reliability refers to consistency with which results are obtained when the same subject is tested more than once under controlled conditions. In above example, there is no correlation between values obtained using two methods (calorimeter & new method). So, both validity & reliability are poor.
Hence, the correct answer is A (Low validity,low reliability). (Ref : Park's Textbook of PSM 25th edition Page no. 86)
The table below shows the relationship between validity and reliability:

### Response:
 g B i.e., Through Umblical Vein
Hence, the correct answer is B (Through umbilicus). (Ref: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 17th/e p- 790)
Intravenous access should be established by cannulation of an umbilcal vessel if possible; this can usually be done within seconds without interrupting chest compressionsQ. If no intravascular return is seen after needle placement into either the umbilicals, then direct intraosseus insertion may be used to establish venous accessQ.
Hence it is important to know that Intravenous access is preferred over intraosseeous infusion during resucitation because IV line has higher success rate than IO lineQ.
Remember:

IV > IO

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 
Explanation: Sex Hormones Binding Globulin (SHBG): SHBG is produced by liver cells under influence of estrogen & testosterone. It binds to both testosterone & estradiol with high affinity but weakly to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The free fraction of these steroids can diffuse into target tissues. Free T3 > Bound T3; Free T4 < bound T4. In males, it has higher concentration than females. So more amount of testosterone gets attached to this protein which makes less amount available for action on body. Hence if there is increase in level of SBHG then decrease in activity of testosterone occurs. If we give anabolic steroid like oxandrolone, its levels increases so that more testosterone becomes unbound and acts at tissue level. Ref : Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology -23rd Ed Page No-425
Hence, the correct answer is A (Testosterone). (Ref: Ganong 23/e p425)
Note: In men, approximately 98% of circulating testosterone is bound to plasma proteins, including albumin and sex-hormone-binding globulin (SBHG), whereas in women, approximately 65% of total testosterone circulates bound to SBHG and albumin.

### Response:
 g Interchange between amino acids at positions b-8 and b-10 (b-8 to b-9 to b-l0)
h The interchange between residues at position b-14 and b -19 has no effect on biological activity.
i Substitution of alanine with valine at residue b-13 reduces but does not abolish biologic activity.
j Replacement of arginine by lysine at position beta-20 abolishes biologic activity.
k Removal of carboxy-terminal pentapeptide also abolishes bioactivity.

Ref : Lippincott book of Biochemistry pg 125
Hence, the correct answer is C (Interchange of A5 & A6). (Ref: Lippencott's Biochemistry 7th/pg 126; Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry Pgno: 130).
Explanation: Insulin molecule consists of two polypeptides chains linked together by S-S bond. 
The A chain contains most of the information required for receptor binding while the B-chain contains all the information necessary for postreceptor events such as activation of tyrosine kinase.
Any alteration which disrupts these regions will result in loss of biological activity.

Hence, the correct answer is B (Internuclear ophthalmo-plegia). (Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 18th/Chapter e26 p= 3249; Kanski Clinical Ophthalmology 6/e p. 455).
Internuclear opthalmoplegia - INO results from damage to medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), which connects the abducens nucleus controlling lateral rectus muscle innervation to the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve that controls medial rectus movement. The lesion causes failure of adduction when attempting horizontal gaze toward the side of the MLF lesionQ. This can be detected by asking patient to follow an object horizontally across his visual field. When moving gaze away from the affected side, nystagmus develops in the abducting eye. In some cases, patients may have diplopia because of weakness of abduction due to coexisting injury to the abducent nerve. Lesions of the brainstem at pontine level cause bilateral internuclear lesions resulting in bilateral INO. Causes include multiple sclerosis, vascular disease, tumors & trauma.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. The median nerve supplies all muscles involved in flexion at metacarpophalangeai joints except the first two (thumb), which are supplied by the thenar branches of the median nerve. It also provides sensation over the lateral three-and-a-half digits. Injury can occur due to direct trauma, compression injury during tight plaster application, laceration, etc. Clinical features include wasting of the thenars with loss of opposition of the thumbs; sensory deficit on the palmar aspect of the lateral side of hand and medial one-and- half fingers; weakness of flexor pollicis brevis, abductor pollics brevis and opponens polliciS; and altered carpal tunnel pressure dynamics leading to carpal tunnelsyndrome. Treatment includes early recognition and release of the constricted bandage if it has caused an area of anaesthesia; splintage in neutral position of wrist and thumb; and exploration within 6 weeks if no recovery occurs.

### Response:
 g Thyroid Storm is an emergency condition that requires immediate treatment to prevent serious complications such as heart failure, coma, and death.

Causes

Ineffective pre-operative hormone control
Man handling of the gland during operation
Poor post operative care
Hence, the correct answer is A (ineffective pre-operative hormon...). (but it's better if you know all four causes).
Hence,
Option D - Ineffective pre-operatively hormonal control can lead to Thyrotoxic crisis in patients with Graves' disease undergoing total thyroidectomy.
Option B - Man-handling of the thyriod gland during surgical procedure may cause bleeding leading to hypovolemic shock which will precipitate into Thyro toxic Crisis.
Option C - Parathryoid glands should be preserved during Total thyroidectomy because they secrete PTH hormones which regulate calcium levels in blood stream.
Option E - Poor Post Operative Care leads to infection at the site of incision which again triggers off Thyro Toxic Crisis.
Hence,

The most common cause of Thyro-toxic Crisis is Inadequate Pre-Operative Preparation of Patient.

Ref: Orthodontics: Diagnosis and Management of Malocclusion and Dentofacial Deformities By Subhash S. Bhat page 1080
Hence, the correct answer is C (Profilometer). (Ref: Textbook of ORTHODONTICS Shobha Tandon 2nd edition page no 1079)
The text also mentions that:

Orthodontic implants have been designed with different diameters ranging between 1 mm and 3.5 mm. They may be made up of titanium alloy, stainless steel, gold, silver, zirconium oxide, or ceramic materials. These screws were originally developed for anchorage purposes but now they are being increasingly used for tooth movement due to their high resistance to torque forces. 
They are available in two types—self-drilling type which does not require drilling into bone before placement; self-tapping type requires predrilling prior to insertion. Self-drilling types are more commonly used than self-taping ones because it reduces the risk of damage to surrounding tissues during placement. However, both"

Question: Decay of enamel following radiotherapy is initiated due to:
Options:
A) Decrease in salivary flow
B) Direct radiations contacting the enamel
C) Dessication of tooth structure
D) Hypocalcification and pitting of enamel
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Direct radiation contact with enamel

Radiation therapy can cause changes in dental hard tissues that may be detected clinically by visual inspection and histologically by light microscopy.

The effects on teeth depend upon several factors including:

1. Dose received (determinant)
2. Volume of tissue irradiated (determinate)
3. Age at time of exposure (susceptible period)

Effects of Radiation Therapy on Dental Hard Tissues

Enamel 

Changes include opacities, hypoplasia, demineralization, surface irregularity, and increased susceptibility to caries. The most common change observed after high-dose radiation treatment was loss of sheen followed by white spots and brown discoloration. These findings were more pronounced when the dose exceeded 50 Gy. In addition, there have been reports of severe enamel hypomineralization resulting in marked mottling and pitted surfaces. This has also been associated with decreased fluoride uptake into developing enamel during periods of active growth. 
Hence, the correct answer is B (Direct radiations contracting the enamel). (- Ref Robbins Basic Pathology 9th edition page no- 795).

### Response:
 g} A i.e., Early Compensated Hypovolemia Shock

Early signs of dehydration in children → Tachycardia (HR >160), sunken eyes, decreased urine output (<1 ml/kg/hr)
Late sign of dehydration → Delayed capillary refill (>2 sec.), poor skin turgor, sunken fontanelle, dry mucous membrane.

Hypotension occurs late in shock when cardiac index falls below 3 L/minute/metre square body surface area.
So, early stage of shock there will be no hypotension but compensatory mechanism like vasoconstriction will occur which may result in increased BP.
Compensated vs Decompensated Shock


Shock can be divided into two phases : -

i) Initial phase (early phase)

In this phase, patient has been able to maintain adequate blood pressure by means of sympathetic stimulation that causes peripheral vascular constriction.


ii) Advanced Phase (late phase)


This phase begins after several hours of inadequate tissue perfusion. Inadequate organ perfusion leads to cellular injury and release of mediators such as histamine, bradykinin etc. These substances cause vasodilatation leading to fall in systemic vascular resistance and decrease in diastolic blood pressure.

### Response:
 g B i.e., Decrease in Pre load Nitrates decrease myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing both pre-load & after- loadQ (but major effect is on preload). They do so by causing venous dilation which results in reduction in total blood volume returning to ventricles - thus reducing end diastolic pressure & wall tension. This reduces left ventricular work & decreases myocardial O2 consumption. Nitroglycerin also causes coronary dilatation that increases blood flow to ischemic areas. But this effect does not contribute significantly to relief of symptoms because it occurs too slowly. The primary cause of pain during an episode of stable angina pectoris is increased myocardial metabolism with resultant increase in intracellular calcium concentration. Increased Ca+2 triggers contraction of myofibrils resulting in increased force of cardiac contractions. This leads to rise in LV systolic pressure, stroke volume, LVEDP, LV wall stress & myocardial metabolic demands. All these factors lead to decreased perfusion of subendocardium leading to ischemia & pain. So, drugs used in treatment of Angina should act rapidly enough to prevent development of severe ischemia. Drugs acting directly on cardiovascular system can reduce myocardial workload by either increasing supply of O2 to ischemich"

 g. The chest x ray in two planes will show the lead positions and whether they have been placed correctly into the right atrium and ventricle. It also shows if there has been perforation of either chamber. If this cannot be determined by plain films then an echocardiogram should be performed. Echocardigraphy can determine where leads lie within the chambers and whether there has heen perforation. A transoesophageal echo may give more information than transthoracic imaging because it gives better images of structures posteriorly located such as the left atrial appendage.

Hence most specific marker of Iron deficiency anemia is ferritin & least sensitive test to detect iron defeciency is serum transferrin saturation.
Harrison writes -
""The hormone hepcidin regulates body iron levels by inhibiting dietary iron absorption in the intestine and reducing release of stored iron from macrophages""
""Serum ferritin concentration reflects total body stores; it falls below normal when storage iron is less than one third of normal"".
""Ferritin also has acute phase reactant propey and may be elevated in inflammation even if there is no underlying iron deficiency.""
Transferrin-saturation = Serum iron / Transferrins x 100%
Normal range : 30% -50 %
<15 % indicates severe IDA
>45% indicate hemolytic anemia

Vascular events of acute inflammation

The vascular changes that occur during acute inflammation have been described as an immediate reaction followed by somewhat delayed reactions.

Immediate Reaction 

This phase begins within minutes after tissue trauma has occurred and lasts for several hours. It consists of two components:

1. Immediate transient vasoconstriction 
2. Immediate prolonged vasodilatation

Immediate Transient Vasoconstrictor Phase

Within seconds to minutes after tissues are injured, there is intense constriction of arterioles and capillaries at the site of injury. This results in decreased blood flow through these vessels and increased resistance to outflow from adjacent veins. As a result, edema fluid accumulates locally because of the inability of lymphatic channels to remove it rapidly enough. In addition,"

### Response:
 g Option D : The diagnosis in this scenario would be high anion-gap metabolic acidemia (HAGMA), which can result from lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, renal failure, salicylate toxicity, methanol intoxication, ethylene glycol poisoning, and severe diarrhea. Metabolic Alkalosis In addition to causing hypokalemia, hyperaldosteronism causes volume depletion by increasing sodium excretion in the urine. This results in contraction alkalosis. Hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkaloses occur when there is loss of gastric fluid rich in hydrogen ions and potassium but relatively poor in chloride. Causes include prolonged nasogastric suctioning; excessive use of antacids containing calcium carbonate; ingestion of large amounts of baking soda; small-bowel fistulae; villous adenomas; Zollinger-Ellison syndrome; and chronic diuretic abuse.

Glycogen Synthetases & Glycosenolyses

The enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis are glycogen synthetase and branching enzyme whereas those involved in its breakdown are glycogens phosphorylases and debranching enzyme.

Key Concept:

Phosphorylase catalyzes the removal of glucose residues from glycogen to form free glucose -1-phosphate which can be converted into glucose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucose mutase.
In contrast, glycogen synthatase adds one molecule of UDP-Glc at a time to growing chain end of glycogen.
Both these reactions require energy input; however, they occur with opposite direction i.e., glycogen degradation requires hydrolysis while glycogen formation needs glycosylation reaction.
Thus, both processes have an ATP requirement but in different directions.
This explains why fasting blood sugar levels fall down because there is no source of glucose available except that derived from glycogenic process.
On the contrary, postprandial rise in blood sugar level"

### Response:
 g) Iodized salt is recommended to be used throughout life except during lactation when it should be avoided because excess iodine may pass into milk. The amount of iodide added to common salt varies between countries but generally ranges from 15-40 mg per kg of salt. In India, 30 ppm (mg/kg) has been fixed by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. This will add approximately 60 mcg of iodides per gram of salt which amounts to an additional supply of 240 mcg/day if one consumes 8 gms of salt per day. It is estimated that this level of fortification would meet the requirement of adults and children above five years age group. For infants below two years of age, they require less than 20 mcg/ day. Hence, their consumption of iodised salt must be restricted to half of what others consume. h) Recommended dietary allowance of iodines is : - i) Infants <6 months = 14mcg j) Children 7-12 yrs= 45mcg k) Adolescent girls = 125mcg l) Adult males = 200mcg m) Pregnant women = 220mcg n) Lactating mothers = 280mcg o) Excess"

D) Integration of viral DNA with host DNA
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Hepatitis B infection can be asymptomatic (chronic carrier state), symptomatic acute hepatitis, fulminant hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver failure, HCC, etc. The most impoant factor that determines whether HBV will cause an acute illness or become persistent is its ability to integrate into the genome of infected cells. This integration leads to continued replication by the cell even when it would normally die. Chronic carriers have high levels of circulating antigenemia which may lead to immune complex disease such as ahralgia, ahritis, nephritic syndrome, vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disorder, lupus erythematosus, thrombocytopaenia, leukopenia, pancytopenia; rarely lymphoma, leukemia, myositis, dermatomyositis. Ref: Harrison, E-18, P-2596

### Response:
 g A (Next Generation Sequencing): Ref: Harper's Biochemistry, 30th editionExplanation:NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCINGIt uses high-throughput DNA sequencers to generate millions of sequences in parallel.It can be used to sequence an entire genome at once.The most common method employs bridge amplification on a surface that has been spotted with oligonucleotides complementary to the target DNA fragments.This approach allows thousands of individual reactions to occur simultaneously, generating hundreds of megabases per run.Pyrosequencing involves sequential addition of deoxynucleotide triphosphates followed by measurement of light emission when incorporated into growing strands of DNA.These methods have greatly reduced costs and increased speed of genomic analysis.They also allow detection of genetic variations such as SNPs and CNVs.SANGER'S TECHNIQUEThe dideoxy chain termination method was developed by Frederick Sanger and colleagues in 1977.In this procedure, four different labeled nucleotides are added sequentially to the nascent strand until one of them terminates its incorporation due to lack of a free hydroxyl group at their 3' end.Western BlottingWestern blots detect proteins using antibodies directed against specific epitopes within those proteins.A sample containing protein(s) of interest is separated according to"

D) Alcohol breath test
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 gastrointestinal disease is common among alcoholics. The most frequent gastrointestinal symptoms include abdominal pain (50-80%), nausea and vomiting (30-60%) and anorexia (20-40%). Upper GI bleeding occurs in approximately 15% of chronic alcohol abusers. Peptic ulceration is more likely than oesophageal varices. Endoscopic evaluation should be performed if there is persistent haematemesis, melena or significant anaemia. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 831
Hence, the correct answer is A (UGI endos copy). (Serum amylase may also be raised but it doesnot help in diagnosis.).. If serum amylas was present then we would have gone for CT scan abdomen. But here no mention of elevated amylases levels so lets go ahead with UGIEndoscopy.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 guyton writes- ""The axons of the purkinje cells leave the cerebellar coex in large bundles called cerebello peduncles. The largest bundle is medial and is called superior cerebellipeduncle. It contains fibres that pass mainly to red nuclei and subthalamic nuclei. Smaller laterally placed bundles are middle and inferior cerebelopontine peduncle. They contain fibres destined primarily for pontine nuclei""
Hence, the correct answer is B (Red nucleus). (Ref : Ganong review of medical physiology 23rd edition page no 256)
Purkinje cell axon leaves the cerebrum through one of three cerebellarpeduncles, all of which end on the ventral posterior interal nucleus ofthalamus. From there, impulses travel up the internal capsule to the motorcortex where they synapse with pyramidal tract neurons.
Hence it travels via red nucleus also but final destination is venterolateral nucleus of Thalamus.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 gout is an inflammatory disease caused by deposition of monosodium urate crystals within joints and soft tissues. The clinical manifestations range from acute attacks to chronic gouty ahropathy. Acute attack can be treated with NSAIDs (first line), colchicine, prednisolone, probenecid, benzbromarone, sulfinpyrazone, allopurinol, febuxostat, pegloticases. Allopurininol and febusxostat are xanthine oxidase inhibitors that decrease production of uric acid. Pegloticasel and rilonacept are monoclonal antibodies against uric acids and IL-1 respectively. They are approved for treatment of refractory cases of hyperurecemia Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2345
Hence, the correct answer is A (Chronic Gout). (Ref : harrison's internal medicine 20 th ed)

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 greatest risk factor for osteoporotic fractures is age (older than 50 years). The most frequent sites of these fractures include the proximal femur, distal radius, vertebrae, ribs, scapula, clavicle, humerus, pelvis, and skull. Fractures at all of these locations can be caused by trauma that would normally result in no injury to healthy bone. In addition, many patients with osteoporosis have multiple fractures; this condition has been termed ""fragility fracture syndrome."" Fragility fractures occur when there is an increase in stress on normal bone without significant external force. This type of fracture may also be called a low-impact fracture because it occurs after minimal trauma. For example, someone who falls while walking might break their wrist but walk away unscathed. A fragility fracture indicates severe loss of bone mass and strength. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 1035
Hence, the correct answer is A (Osteoporasis). (but keep in mind that osteopenia is more commonly used term instead of osteoporasis).

Second Messenger System in Smooth Muscle

Smooth muscles have two types of receptors that mediate contraction on stimulation with hormones.

Receptors coupled to phospholipase-CQ which increases intracellular calcium concentration through IP3/DAG system. This results in increased myofilament sensitivity to cytoplasmic calcium ions leading to contraction. Examples include muscarinic M1 receptor stimulated by acetylcholine, histamine Hl receptor, serotonin SHTI receptor etc.

Receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase enzyme resulting in increase in intracellular cyclic AMP levels. The rise in cAMP activates protein kinase A which phosphorylates several proteins involved in regulation of contractility. These receptors are called adenylyl cyclase linked receptors. They are activated by catecholamines like adrenaline, noradrenaline, PGE2, FSH, LH, ACTH, glucagon, VIP, Forskolin etc. Adenylate Cyclase Linked Receptors in Smooth Muscles

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g A i.e., Lead III
Hence, the correct answer is A (III). The maximum voltage in lead II occurs when the QRS complex has an average vector directed superiorly, to the left, and posteriorly at approximately -60deg. This direction corresponds with that of normal ventricular depolarization. When this type of electrical activity is recorded by leads placed on the chest wall, it produces large positive deflections in V5 and V6, smaller positive deflection in V2 through V4, small negative deflections (or sometimes biphasic waves) in V1 and V2, and no detectable changes in V3 and V4. On the extremities, these potentials produce tall P waves in lead aVR, small positive deflec- tions in lead I, and large positive defections in both aVL and aVF. These findings indicate that the right arm electrode records primarily atrial rather than ventricular activation; therefore, it should never be used to record the P wave. Because the potential difference between the right leg and the left arm electrodes is greatest in lead III, it provides the largest signal-to-noise ratio among all limb leads and thus is usually preferred over leads I and a VF.

### Response:
 g
Hence, the correct answer is A (Mitral regurgitation (MR)). The most common valve involved in ARF is mitral valve followed by aoic valve. MR occurs early while MS develops late after ARF.
Hence the correct Answer is A ((Mitral refurgitation). (MR). Explanation: Most commonly affected valves in Rheumatic hea disease - Mitral > Aoic In Acute Rheumatic Fever - Mitra! Valve involvement is more common than Aoic Valve involvement. Amongst Valves - Mitrial Valve involvement occur earlier than Aoical Valve involvement.
Harrison writes- ""The earliest manifestation of RHD may be an asymptomatic midsystolic murmur at the apex due to mild mitral insufficiency.""
In Chronic RHD - Mitriai Stenosi is more Common than Mitral Insufﬁciency & Aoic Stenoiis is More Common than Aoie Insuﬀiency.

### Response:
 g
Hence, the correct answer is B (Obstruction of lympathic ducts.). (Ref: Bailey & Love's sho practice of surgery,25th edition, pg no. 828)
Hence peaud orange appearance in carcinoma breast occurs because of obstruction of Lymphatics which causes edema of skin leading to this characteristic appearance.
Peau-d-orange refers to an appearance that resembles the peel of an orange; it results when cutaneous lymph vessels become obstructed by cancer cells within the dermis. The resulting edema produces pitting on palpation and gives rise to the ""peau-dorange"" sign.
The most common cause of peau-d-orangeforamenifera is metastasis of breast cancer into axillary lymph nodes. It can also be seen with inflammatory breast cancer, where tumor infiltration leads to blockage of superficial lymphatics.
It may occur in patients who have undergone mastectomy if there has been incomplete removal of all involved tissue.

### Response:
 g Atrial septal defect (ASD)
Hence, the correct answer is A (ASDs). (Note - In case of patent ductus arteriosus also IE can occur but it occurs at an older age than that of VSD).
Endocardial involvement

Infective Endocarditis may involve either native heart valves or prosthetic valve.

Native valvular lesions → Most common site of infection is on left side i.e., Mitral > Aoic > Tricuspid > Pulmonary.
Prosthetic Valves → Both early & late after surgery can be involved. Early infections develop within first year after operation while late onset infections usually present more than one decade later. Prosthesis in position <1 month old have highest risk to get infected followed by those between 1-12 months. Risk decreases thereafter. The most frequent sites of infection are :-

i) Mitral Valve → Most commonly affected prosthesis.
ii) Aortic Valve → Second most frequently affected.
iii) Tricuspid Valve → Least often affected.
iv) Pulmonic Valve → Rarely affected.
Hence infective endocatitis does not affect atrial septal defects because they do not cause turbulent flow which leads to endothelial damage and hence"

D) Metronidazole
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Ref : KDT 6/e p750-751,755
Hence, the correct answer is A (Rifampicinc). (Ref: Katzung Pharmacology; 12th ed., pg no: 1011)
The mechanism of action of rifamycin group includes inhibition of bacterial RNA polymerase by binding to its beta subunit which results in interference with transcription process. The drug inhibits both gram positive & negative bacteria including mycobacteria but has little effect on fungi & viruses.
Linezolid acts by inhibiting protein synthesis through binding to ribosomal P site thus preventing incorporation of aminoacyl t-RNA into mRNA - ribosome complex.
Nitroimidazoles act by causing reduction of nitro group resulting in generation of highly reactive intermediate that causes damage to cell membrane proteins & nucleic acids.
Metronidazol is used against anaerobic infections like giardiasis, amoebiasis etc.
Hence it can be concluded that all these drugs inhibit macromolecular syntheses except rifampicins which interfere with transcription.
Note:- All the above mentioned antibiotics have bacteriostatic activity except linezolid which is bacteriocidal.

Question: Earliest diagnosis of pregnancy can be established safely by:
Options:

C) hCG levels
D) MRI pelvis
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g C i.e., hCG level - The earliest sign of intrauterine pregnancy is detection of yolk sacQ followed by embryo (fetus). Cardiac activity is seen at 5-6 weeks gestation. Transvaginal sonography has increased sensitivity in detecting early pregnancies with an accuracy rate of 96% when compared to transabdominal ultrasound which detects pregnancy after 5 weeks. However, TVS cannot detect pregnancy before 3 weeks. Serum beta-hCG measurement is used to confirm pregnancy & estimate its duration. It may also help diagnose ectopic pregnancy. Levels >35,000 mIU/ml on day 25 of pregnancy indicate normal intra uterine pregnancy. Values <5000mIU/ ml on day21 indicates non-viable IUT. A value between these two suggests possible Ectopic Pregnancy. Intra abdominal MR1 does not have sufficient resolution to visualize fetus earlier than 10weeks gestational age.
Hence, the correct answer is C (hCG levels). (Ref: Textbook of Obstetrics D.C.Dutta 7th edition page no 55)

D) 7-10 mm
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g The connector is placed at least 5mm away from the free gingiva in order to avoid interference with the periodontal tissues during function.

Ref: Phillip’s Science of Dental Materials ed 12 pg 138
Hence, the correct answer is D (7-8 mm). (But it can also be C i.e., 3 - 6 mm).
Explanation: The connector must extend onto sound tooth structure on both sides of the edentulous area so that there will be sufficient bulk of material between the occluso-gingival forces applied by the prosthesis and the underlying bone. It should be located at least three millimeters apical to the mucogingival junction because this distance provides adequate support for the soft tissue overlying the abutment teeth. 
It should be positioned at least five millimeters coronally to the alveolar crest because this location allows enough space for the normal contour of the interdental papilla and prevents damage to the attached gingiva when the denture moves against the supporting structures during mastication, speech, or swallowing.

Prothrombotic disorders - Thromboembolic disease may be caused by inherited abnormalities in coagulation factors that result in hypercoagulability. The most common such abnormality is factor V Leiden mutationQ, an acquired resistance to protein C due to loss-of-function mutations in this gene. Other causes include deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein S, or protein C, homozygous homocysteinemia, prothrombic mutations in the factor V gene (factor V Leidem), and the G20210G variant in the fibrinogen gene. These conditions predispose patients to venous thrombi but do not cause bleeding diathesis because they affect pathways distal to factor X activation. Factor VIII deficiency can also lead to recurrent thrombosis, although it usually presents with hemorrhage.

 gates of TCA cycle (anapleurotic reactions). Anaplerosis refers to the process by which intermediates such as citrate, succinyl-CoA, fumarate, malate, and alpha-ketoglutarate enter into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The term ""anapleros"" means ""to fill up"". This filling-up occurs in order to maintain homeostasis within the cell when there is a need for more ATP production. In this way, it can be said that anaplers play a role in maintaining cellular energy balance.Ref: Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry; 30th edition; Chapter 17; Metabolism of Carbohydrates & Lipids During Exercise

### Response:
 g A (Pulmonary emboli) : The maximum Alveolo-arterial O2 gradient occurs with pulmonary embolization because of obstruction to blood flow through the lungs. This results in an increase in dead space ventilation and decreased perfusion of some areas of the lung. In severe cases, this can lead to shunting of deoxygenated venous blood into the arterial circulation. Other causes include respiratory failure due to pneumonia, ARDS, interstitial fibrosis, emphysema, bronchitis, etc. Causes of increased alveolo - arterial O2 tension (PAO2-Aa02): * Hyperventilation * Dead Space Ventilation * Shunt Fraction * Diffusing Capacity Decreased

### Response:
 g C i.e., Vein Of galen anamolous
Hence, the correct answer is C (Vein of Gallen malformations). (<a href="" > <a href=""
Explanation: The clinical features in this child suggest the diagnosis of vein of galein malformation.

The presence of congestive cardiac failure suggests that there must be high output state which occurs due to arteriovenous fistula formation between feeding artery & draining vein → High flow through vein causes congestive hea failure.
Presence of bruit over head also supports the diagnosis because it indicates turbulent blood flow within abnormal vessels.
On transcranial ultrasound, vein of galen malformaton appears as a large midline hypoechogenic lesion occupying most of the third ventricle.
It can cause hydrocephalus by obstructing CSF outflow at level of aqueduct of sylvius.
Encephalocoele does not present with these symptoms.
Arachnoids cysts do not have bruits and they don't produce high-output cardiac failure.

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g C (24 hrs after recovery form shock)
Hence, the correct answer is C (After 24 hours of recovery from Shock). (Ref : Park's Textbook of PSM 22nd edition Page no- 262)Explanation:Dengue Hemorrhagic fever -The clinical features include sudden onset with chills, high grade continuous fever, headache, retroorbital pain, nausea vomiting, myalgia, arthralgia, rash which may resemble measles, thrombocytopenic purpura, bleeding manifestations like epistaxis, hematuria, melena etc.The treatment consists of fluid replacement using Ringer lactate solution in severe cases.Intravenous fluids should be continued until there is complete resolution of shock and adequate oral intake has been established.Amongst the given options, ""after 24hours of recovery"" seems to be the most appropriate choice.During this period, we can ensure that the patient will have sufficient platelets count (>10000/mm3), normal hematocrit levels (<30%) and absence of signs of active bleeding.Patients who meet these criteria can safely be sent home on follow up basis.
Hence the correctanswer is C ((After 2 days of recovery form Shock).). (REF : PARK"

Question: According to the instrument formula given by G.V. Black, the primary cutting edge angle should be:
Options:
A) >50 degree
B) >90 degree
C) <50 degree
D) <90 degree
First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g. <50°

Explanation: The primary cutting edges of the upper teeth have an average inclination of approximately 20 degrees in both males and females. 
The lower incisors have slightly more acute angles (15-18 degrees). These values were determined using radiographs taken with the patient’s mouth closed.

Ref: Sturdevant operative dentistry 7th edition page no 8
Hence, the correct answer is C (<50 degree). (ref:Sturdevent Operative Dentistry 6/e p3)
Note: Primary Cutting Edge Angle Formula:

G.V.Black Instrument Formula

Primary cutting edge = 180 – Secondary cutting edge
Secondary cutting edge + Terminal slope = 100
Terminal slope x 2 = Primary cutting edge

Cutting Edge Angles

Upper anterior teeth: 30 -40°
Lower anterior teeth : 10 -25°
Posterior teeth: Less than 5°
Key Concept:
According to GV black's formula, the terminal slope multiplied by two gives us the primary cuttng edge. Therefore, if we assume that the secondary cutting edge is zero then the primary will be equal to twice the terminal slop which would be less than 50°.

Hence, the correct answer is C (Zone of irritation). (Ref: Gutierrez - Preventive & Social Medicine - 25/e p-100)
The plaque forms at sites where there is stagnation of saliva due to irregularities in teeth or ill-fitting dentures. The initial deposit consists mainly of glycoproteins derived from salivary secretions and bacterial products. This layer acts as a nidus for further deposits of organic material such as food paicles, dead cells, epithelial cells, leukocytes, erythrocytes, microorganisms, and minerals including calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite. These substances accumulate between the layers of protein matrix forming an amorphous mass called dental calculus or tartar. It may be smooth-surfaced or rough surfaced depending upon whether it has formed over gingival margin or elsewhere. Calculus formation stas with the precipitation of calcium salts around particles of organic matter such as bacteria, epithelium, necrotic tissue, hair, suture fragments, root canal filling materials, orthodontic appliances"

### Response:
 g Spastic diplegia has no significant musculoskeletal deformities except mild contractures in fingers & toes.
Hence, the correct answer is A (Spastic quadriparesis). The most common cause of death among children with CP is respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. Other causes include sepsis, cardiac disease, seizures, and sudden infant death syndrome. Scoliosis occurs more frequently in patients who have hemiplegia than those who have bilateral spasticity. It also tends to occur at an earlier age in these patients. In addition, it may be seen in association with severe mental retardation and dystonia.
Harrison writes - ""Scoliosis develops in approximately one-third of all individuals with cerebral paly, but its incidence increases dramatically when there is involvement of both legs.""

First, think about the reason for each option. Then, choose the single best option from the given 4 options only and provide the response as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. Do not choose any other option.
### Response:
 g Thrombin is an enzyme that causes blood to clot (coagulate). It does this by causing fibrinogen in your plasma to change into long strands of insoluble protein called fibrin. This creates a web-like mesh around red blood cells and platelets, which stops bleeding when you get injured.

Ref : Lippincott illustrated biochemistry 6th ed page no 120
Hence, the correct answer is B (Throm-bin formation). (but it's worth noting that vitamin k actually helps in production of coagulation factor II VII IX X & Protein C & S).
Vitamin K also has some role in bone health because it activates osteocalcin, a hormone produced by osteoblasts that promotes calcium deposition in bones.
Hence there is no direct relation between vitamin K and corticosteroid action.
Also note that bishydoxycoumarins like warfarin inhibit vitamin K dependent carboxylation reaction required for activation of these proteins.
So they act indirectly on thrombin formation by inhibiting its precursor i.e. Factor IIa.
Production of cloting factors by Liver requires Vit.K but anticoagulant effect of Coumarins is due to inhibition of vit.k activity.

### Response:
 g B i.e., Postpartum (Immediate)
Hence, the correct answer is B (Immediate postpartumn). (Ref: Textbook of Obstetrics D.C.Dutta 6th edition page no-55).
The maximum cardiac output in pregnancy is reached at approximately 32 to 34 weeks gestationQ and then remains constant until delivery. The immediate postpaum period represents another time when there may be an increase in cardiac output due to pain, anxiety, blood loss, and uterine contractions.Q - Williams Obs 23/e p1011
Cardiac Output During Pregnancy

During normal pregnancy, cardiac output increases by 40% above nonpregnancy values by 20 weeks' gestation and reaches its peak value of +50% just before term. This increased cardiac output results primarily from augmented stroke volume rather than tachycardia; however, both components contribute to this hemodynamic adaptation.

Increased Cardiac Output In Parturition

In addition to these changes that occur with pregnancy, labor causes further augmentation of cardiac output secondary to pain-induced sympathetic stimulation, vasodilation caused by oxytocin release, and direct effects of uteroplacental contraction on venous return.

 gans (Plasmodia). The schizogony is followed by another stage called gametogony which occurs within RBCs. Gametes formed during this phase are responsible for infecting mosquitoes that act as vectors for transmitting malarial parasites to humans. In P.falciparumschizonts do not appear in peripheral circulation due to adhesion to vascular endothelial cells. This phenomenon is known as cytoadherence. It may be related to pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. Ref : Paniker's textbook of parasitology Pgno: 81
